One of the attributes of good government is the ability to confront challenges. There is no doubt that the Government confronts a challenge greater than any we have seen on many previous occasions. However, I am convinced the Government, under the Taoiseach Deputy Cowen, is capable of meeting the challenges. The Fianna Fáil Party, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats, together with the Independent Deputies, will recognise and overcome the difficulties we face.

It is vital that the solidarity and courage required of people who support the Government should be seen throughout the country in the coming days and weeks. We will face significant [39]challenges with the education cuts, agriculture cuts and others. It is vital, therefore, that we stand up and defend the Government for doing the right thing.

I am amazed by the response of the Fine Gael Party to the budget. A defining moment in my 26 years in the Dáil was the 1987 budget when Ray McSharry had to take difficult decisions, just as we do today. At the time, Alan Dukes had the courage to put the country and the best interest of the economy before the political parish pump. It is rather sad to witness what we have seen from Fine Gael in the House over the past few days. The Government has had to make difficult decisions. It had to make the decision to raise tax by €2 billion in net terms so that it would end up with a general Government deficit that is still high, at 6.5% of GDP.

The Fine Gael finance spokesman said this week that if Fine Gael were in power it would not raise taxes, but would instead bring in a budget with a 5.5% deficit. This can only mean Fine Gael favours further expenditure cuts, totalling more than €4 billion, because to reduce the deficit from 6.5% to 5.5% would cost more than €2 million. I challenge Deputy Richard Bruton to confirm that is the position and to tell us how he would make those cuts. I challenge him to tell the farmers at the weekend meetings the cuts Fine Gael would make — I am sure Fine Gael will say the cuts are terrible and it would not make them. I ask Fine Gael to tell the teachers and parents who will challenge us over the next number of weeks what cuts it would make in education if not the ones proposed by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O’Keeffe.

The Fine Gael performance with regard to the budget has been cowardly and political. This is a sad day. I am convinced that when we have the next general election, the electorate will see Fine Gael for the Opposition it has been, full of opportunism. Take health, for example. Deputy Richard Bruton wants to cut €700 million more in health than the cuts made by the Minister, Deputy Harney, or than provided for in the budget.

Fine Gael does not have a proper approach to a budgetary framework or to the planning or allocation of money. Week in and out Fine Gael Deputies call for more spending. On the Adjournment last night, we had Deputy Olwyn Enright calling for more speech therapists. Fine Gael Deputies continue to call for more services here, there and everywhere. However, when there are some difficult decisions to be taken——

I will listen to Deputy Sheehan when I have finished. The reality is that the Fine Gael opposition to this budget has been rather pathetic. I have often listened to Deputy Reilly since he came into this House and I must admit I have been rather impressed with him. However, I have never seen such hypocrisy as I have seen from this man during the debate in the past two days. I know he has been quoted already. Speaking in December 2007 about the deal he did on the over 70s medical card he said:

I represented the doctors. I got the best deal I could for my members . . . That was my job at the time.

He also said:

[40]
But I did point out at the time that it was inappropriate prioritisation. What I meant by that was I didn’t want 70-year-old millionaires getting a medical card, when Johnny, who is on two inhalers, and his Dad is on 15 grand a year, doesn’t have it.

He went on to say that he wanted to see the over 70s medical card means tested. He said:

Should Tony O’Reilly have a medical card? We have limited resources and they should be prioritised for those greatest in need. I don’t think it should be a case of who deserves it, but who needs it.

That is the statement of the Fine Gael spokesman on health only 12 months ago.

I heard this man last night talking about the 70 year old man on a trolley and whether he should declare he has a medical card. Considerable criticism, much of it fair, has been made by the over 70s about the confusion surrounding this scheme. I put it back to Deputy Reilly and Fine Gael. What about the 65 year old man slightly over the present medical card limit who is ill in hospital and cannot get a medical card? Fine Gael is suggesting we should keep the rules for him but we should give the medical card to the man who now will have, perhaps, €150,000 in income.

I heard Deputy Rabbitte talking about those very wealthy people. He said they did their patriotic duties by the State. A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I have great admiration for your party colleague in my constituency, Deputy Michael D. Higgins. I am often tempted to give him a higher preference than I should, as he was my old teacher aside from other things.

However, any socialist in the country must be wondering what the Labour Party is about. We have heard so much concern from Labour and Fine Gael about the 5% they now tell us should get a medical card.

What kind of socialism is involved in giving that 5% of the community a medical card?

Of course Deputy Rabbitte does not really believe that the 5% now left without a medical card should have one — we all know he does not believe it — but it is typical of the hypocrisy we have heard from Fine Gael and Labour in recent days. I make one prediction. In the general election in three or four years’ time, or whenever it comes, if Fine Gael and Labour really believe that the electorate is sufficiently gullible to the kind of politics they will get from those two parties in an alternative Government, they have another thing coming to them. The reality is they will not fool the electorate at this stage.

There is no point on the one hand claiming they want €4 billion in cuts in public expenditure and then going out and telling all the interest groups they will not cut their areas. That is hypocrisy. The electorate is more sensible than to believe that kind of stuff. [41] If the Opposition had the courage to do what the former Deputy Alan Dukes did, it would get considerably more respect from the electorate.

I wish to speak about some of the positive measures in the budget. The Government’s definitive statement that the 12.5% corporation tax will not be increased is very significant. I hope that in the way the Minister put the matter in the budget he will be happy to consider reducing it when the time is right. The 12.5% corporation tax is the single most vital aspect of the Irish success story. It matters to the multinationals already here and those considering locating here. There are other factors, including of course the workforce and our infrastructure. However, the taxation matter is critical and I welcome its insertion in the Budget Statement. We cannot ignore the fact that we are now competing with countries with lower rates of corporation tax.

I also welcome the announcement on the research and development credit. The Tánaiste is to be complimented on the way in which she put forward this measure for consideration by the Minister for Finance. With all the other controversies around the world, people might not have noticed that the row in Washington about the $700 billion also cast doubt on the US provision for research and development tax credits. According to Ralph Hellmann of the US Information Technology Industry Council who was quoted recently in the wall Street Journal, this was disastrous for the US. What could be disastrous for that country could be good news for us. That announcement in the budget is significant good news for us. The Government decision has positioned us for this US opportunity and put us at the forefront of research and development regimes globally. This is where we need to be and will leave us well positioned when the economy starts to recover.

I also welcome the Minister’s announcement on intellectual property. It is vital that Ireland and the EU have a strong legal framework on intellectual property. China and the other countries that had problems in this area have straightened up their acts. We can no longer rely on people being afraid to patent in these jurisdictions. Ireland needs to put itself at the forefront of intellectual property legal regimes and introduce incentives. Ireland should consider introducing an artists’ exemption-type scheme for scientists and others who base themselves here, register patents here, carry out research and development here and bring the associated jobs and revenue to this country. We could have special zones for such inventors and developers of intellectual property. I look forward to the Commission on Taxation making favourable recommendations to the Minister for Finance in this regard and I urge it to do so quickly. These three areas are of great significance in the context of ensuring that Ireland continues to attract international foreign investment and create new jobs.

I also wish to refer to the 6.5% deficit. This issue has been lost in the frenzy that has happened in the past week. We cannot underestimate the seriousness of the fiscal position in which we find ourselves. A 6.5% deficit in 2009 assumes relatively small contractions in GDP in 2008 and 2009. Exports are assumed to grow next year by 2.5% in real terms. However, recent examination of the global economy makes that export projection appear somewhat optimistic. If the global economy suffers a deep recession, which appears increasingly likely, Ireland’s fiscal deficit will be much higher than 6.5% of GDP. We could be facing a budget deficit of more than 10% of GDP in 2009, which would involve the necessity for large increases in tax revenues to reduce that deficit gradually over a four to five-year period. That is the essential element of the budget. The budget’s proposals need to be implemented and not the kind of winner-takes-all approach that we have seen from the Opposition during the budget debate.

The Opposition’s one shining white light, Deputy Bruton, did not contribute to the farcical debate in the House over the past two nights. Every party needs to understand the main priority for the country is that we face up to the difficult fiscal position. If we do so, we will progress [42]out of a recession much quicker than any other country. I challenge Deputy Burton to outline how we will not increase taxes while reducing expenditure by €400 million.
