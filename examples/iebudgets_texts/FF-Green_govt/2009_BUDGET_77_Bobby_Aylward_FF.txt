I thank my esteemed colleague, Deputy O’Rourke, for sharing her time and for the compliment. I appreciate it as I am sure I will not get many more today.

The intensity of the public debate surrounding this budget has been ferocious and the public response has been extremely hostile so far. Granted, the issue which has received the most focus is emotive and does not easily lend itself to rational discussion. We can learn some very useful and constructive lessons from this controversy. It is now high time to have a cool head and reflect calmly on the issues this debate has thrown up. We must move on in a more enlightened and even-handed way.

As a nation, we must face up to the acute and pervasive problems which will affect all of us in one way or another. We must take these problems very seriously and we must all act with a strong and deliberate sense of public duty. We must approach our circumstances with a reinforced unity of purpose.

We are confronted by adversity now and the truth is we are not used to that. It is incumbent on all of us now, politicians and citizens alike, to behave wisely and reasonably. The national interest, both on an economic and a social level, are at stake and the quicker we all realise [52]that, the better. The corrective policies which we adopt now are vital if we want to restore order and stability to the public finances and to the economy in general.

It is very important that the central thrust of this Government’s intention should not be lost in all the emotion, the political drama and the arguments which have been played out everywhere in the past week or more. We cannot afford to allow ourselves to be deflected from our main job of work, which entails many hard choices and tough decisions. We must take remedial action now to ensure we manage the public finances correctly and continue to promote economic growth and prosperity when we emerge from the doldrums of the current global crisis.

We cannot delude ourselves. We must all remember and understand that we are now living in severely altered circumstances compared to those which prevailed up to very recently. The harsh reality is that our revenues are vastly depleted compared to those we have had at our disposal and which we have enjoyed. The bald fact is we have much less money to share and there are ever-increasing demands on the public purse. We must make judicious decisions about where that money is spent. We have so many competing and deserving interests but the onus is on the Government to ensure that the taxpayers’ money is spent carefully and invested prudently. The Government is compelled to make these strategic decisions based on the bigger national picture and take the overall long view.

We must understand that the Government is motivated purely and simply by financial practicalities and fiscal constraints. The clear intention is to economise and allocate the available resources evenly and fairly while at the same time identifying areas of spending which can be reduced. This — no more and no less — is in the national interest.

The Government is driven by the clear need to cut its cloth to suit its measure and the budget is formulated in the context of much less money to go around on everyone. The overriding imperative is to direct these scarce resources to those who need them most, which is basic common sense.

It is not the intention of the Government to victimise or penalise any section of our society. It is not the intention to cause hardship, rather, this is a concerted and genuine attempt to tackle some of the more expensive aspects of our recurring costs. Public expenditure must be reduced as much as possible on the current side and as much as is practical on the capital side.

The Government’s objective is to effect real savings in areas where they should be attained and where escalating costs cannot be justified. The stark reality with which we must grapple is that tax revenues will diminish for the next couple of years. While we have many bitter pills to swallow to rectify our position, if we take our medicine now we can maintain our living standards in the longer term. We have enjoyed so much comfort in the past 12 years or so that we now find it hard to adjust our collective mentality. We have grown accustomed to unprecedented levels of prosperity and it seems to be difficult to adapt to a more frugal approach. However, we have no choice but to adjust our priorities immediately.

The Government is being realistic. It recognises that shrewd management of the public finances is essential at this time. We must cut back on our expenditure and we must find savings wherever we can. The Government is acting with honourable intent and its bona fides are genuine.

It is acting in the national interest based on its informed assessment of the economy and the prognosis for the next couple of years. The Government is forced to operate within the current parameters for public spending and to do otherwise would be reckless and certainly would do untold damage to the long-term budgetary strategy of this country.

[53]There is an element of the medical card debate that is relevant and worth noting in the wider context of this finance debate. I am glad the principle of means testing has been retained in this instance. I believe it to be a fair way of assessing whether an individual can afford to pay his or her own way. It is generally accepted that anyone who can afford to pay should pay for some of the State services they receive. Virtually no one disagrees with that principle. No one expects the taxpayer and the State to carry the entire cost for those who have sufficient means to pay their own way. In an ideal world with limitless resources, of course it would be desirable to retain the concept of universality or automatic entitlement but the pressing reality now is that we simply cannot afford to extend that luxury to everyone, irrespective of their means. I do not believe there will be any resistance to the introduction of means testing, which is a fair basis on which to assess the capacity to pay or the ability to do without State assistance in certain cases. Moreover, it allows the State to disburse limited resources on a fair and even basis. Ultimately, it will ensure that available moneys are delivered to those who need the support of the State to meet their daily needs or to provide essential public services.

The unvarnished truth is that international forces and domestic factors have conspired to make our fiscal situation extremely difficult. The Government must readjust its spending priorities in the light of this rapid downturn. It must be both cautious and discerning in the allocation of taxpayers’ money. Obviously, moneys targeted at one group necessarily will mean that another group will be deprived. The Government must reconcile the books and must use its resources as effectively as it can. With this in mind, I do not believe that anyone would refuse to pay or would expect the taxpayer to bear his or her costs for some of the State services. It is only fair and equitable and I firmly believe most people will regard that as a very reasonable proposition when we are living through times which demand more restraint.

Everyone must have a sense of good conscience and fair play. Unfortunately, some people in our society are disadvantaged and are in need of State support and assistance to improve their quality of life. That is the precise reason total spending on social welfare next year will be €19.6 billion. I welcome that such expenditure will directly benefit 1.5 million people. Members must acknowledge they have a bounden duty to support the men and women who rely solely on the State to assist them in making ends meet and I am satisfied the Government has discharged this duty well. At the same time, one must recognise there are those who do not need the intervention of the State to maintain their living standards and to carry certain costs. We have no option but to exercise great caution in the distribution of public moneys and one must be sure that everyone gets their fair share. Fairness is the operative word in this regard and is no less than a moral obligation in these straitened times.

Like running any good business outfit, Members must guarantee that the State is getting good value for money, must identify any forms of waste and must ensure that such waste is eliminated. Members must ensure that all agencies of the State are carrying out a useful role and function and if there is room for rationalisation within the apparatus of State, they simply must examine the structures carefully and must manage strategic reform of that sector. In that context, I look forward to the publication of the Government’s proposals for public sector reform in the coming days and weeks.

Efficiencies must be achieved in respect of both costs and work practices throughout the State. In essence, the onus is on Members to ensure the taxpayer receives good value for money and that such money is being spent productively and to good effect.

[54]The Government faces significant economic and social challenges, which are being addressed in a forthright manner. It is single-mindedly determined to meet those challenges within the framework of this budget. As the Taoiseach noted, Ireland is very much open for business. We must keep a steady hand on the wheel to ensure we maintain our international reputation as a good place to do business. It is essential to ensure that the right environment is sustained in order that Ireland continues to be an attractive location for direct inward investment. The Government’s sustained focus is on enterprise and job creation, on increasing exports and developing new markets. Consequently, we must ensure that we remain competitive, have the appropriate skills base and that our tax and regulatory regimes are conducive to increased investment, expansion and job creation.

The budget sets out a well defined path towards economic recovery in the next few years. Although the path may be difficult, our destination is attainable. If we all resolve to make our own contribution, we will be well placed to seize the opportunities that a renewed economy will present. This budget represents a sound blueprint with a balanced share of strategic investment in order that this country will be well poised to capture the benefits which will come our way in time. We must remember that our basic economic structure is in good condition. However, unless we implement the right measures now, we will dismantle all the positive improvements that have been made to this economy over the last decade. We must ensure the economy is robust in order that it can withstand the ravages of the worldwide financial turmoil and is in a strong position to re-establish itself as a progressive, modern and open economy.

The budget is not all about finance and the economy. The people, who have worked hard to make this economy so vibrant and resilient, are being treated in a fair and practical way and those who are marginalised are getting the State support they deserve. We are all in this together and are all in this for the long haul. I am convinced we can achieve our aims if we combine to show a generous sense of public-spiritedness and a modicum of fair play for everyone. This budget is a collective endeavour that demands the commitment and support of every man and woman in this country.
