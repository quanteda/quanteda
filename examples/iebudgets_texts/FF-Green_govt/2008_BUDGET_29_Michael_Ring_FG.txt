I am glad to get the opportunity to speak on the budget because many of the announcements made by Ministers are not made in this House, but in Northern Ireland or in Government Buildings where none of us can go in to hear them. They can brief and tell the media what they want, but we cannot get the opportunity to argue with them. I was glad to see my colleague went to a press briefing to hear the Minister for Education and Science last week, but the Minister did not like it and wanted him removed from the meeting. He had a right to be there as Opposition spokesman.

From 1995 to 1997, Fine Gael was in Government. I have often heard the Minister of State come in here to make announcements and compare that time to the present day. I want to make a simple comparison for him. Fine Gael and Labour handed over Government in 1997 with a surplus, the first time since the foundation of the State the Government ran a surplus.

This economy was booming for ten great years. When the choir was clapping, singing and dancing to congratulate the Minister for Finance last year, we nearly had to bring in the national orchestra to play the music for it.

Within a year, the same Minister came into the House with a deficit [761]instead of a surplus. He will now have to borrow. I am speaking slowly because some of the Deputies opposite are a little deaf from listening to me shout. Perhaps I will be calm and quiet. The Government is going to have to borrow €5 billion to run the country.

The Government, and particularly the Minister for Finance, have squandered that much money. According to what they said in May of this year, there were no problems in the economy, the health sector, the education system or the agriculture industry. The Government said it would not be able to spend all the money it was collecting from taxpayers.

The taxpayers’ revenue was squandered by the Government within a short amount of time.

The Government has squandered our money. I will remind the Deputies opposite of something of which the Government has made a total mess. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, spoke last week about the reform of stamp duty. He had three or four opportunities to deal with stamp duty over the past year, after he received warnings from everybody in the industry. I have no sympathy for the builders. I am delighted by what has happened.

I hope every second one of them goes bankrupt because they robbed, blackguarded and destroyed young people in this country. I can give an example from last Thursday’s The Irish Times. There might not be as many builders running into the Fianna Fáil tent at the Galway Races next year. They might be on [762]the Green Party’s bicycles next year because they will not be in their Mercs.

They will not have the money next year to be throwing it into Fianna Fáil.

The Irish Times reported last Thursday that builders and developers had been able to drop the price of houses — not by €1,000, not by €5,000 but by €100,000. Shame on them because if they could sell the houses for €100,000 less last week, they should have sold them for €100,000 less last year.

They were robbing the young people of this country by mortgaging them in a way that puts them under pressure for the next 40 years. Thanks be to God that the good days are over for the builders because they ripped off the young people of this country when they had the opportunity to do so. They blackguarded them. Having spoken to auctioneers, I know they were not satisfied to be getting €400,000 for houses which had been valued at €180,000. People are not buying houses off the plans — or off The Irish Times or the Irish Independent— anymore. I sometimes wonder whether there is a God, but I know now there is when I see what is happening to the builders who misbehaved over recent years.

The Minister for Finance could have helped young people by reforming stamp duty and doing something in relation to mortgages, but he did not do so. He thought the boom would never end. The Government has squandered the boom and destroyed the country. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, who thinks he will be Taoiseach within a few months, is depending on increased growth next year. He was sitting where the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, is sitting now when he told us last year there would be a budget surplus of €1.7 billion this year. Instead of that, we will have to borrow €5 billion this year.

Shame on the Minister.

He could not manage the country at a time when it was going well.

He squandered our boom. He squandered our future.

Now we are back to the hairshirt budgets again.

The Government will know before next year that the increase of 7% or 14% in the health budget will not pay for the wage increases under the benchmarking process. It will not even meet inflation, and by God will we have inflation given that medical inflation is twice as high again. People protested about cancer services outside the Dáil a few weeks ago. People are waiting for hip operations, or heart operations. I spoke the other day to a 92 year old woman who has been waiting for 15 months for a cataract operation that takes six minutes.

The Minister for Health and Children, the Department of Health and Children and the Government, rather than the National Treatment Purchase Fund, should be providing such services. We should not have to send our loved ones to England or Northern Ireland to be operated on.

We are not able to do it here despite all the money we are spending on health. We should be doing it here. Is the National Treatment Purchase Fund the best answer Deputy Blaney can come up with? His comments remind me of the reply I received today when I tabled a question to the Minister for Education and Science about the results of a young man’s junior certificate examination. The Deputies opposite should listen to this as an example of the kind of country we have now. Deputy Blaney was very quiet when he was an Independent. Has he found a mouth now that he has joined Fianna Fáil?

We are paying people to correct exams. Perhaps Deputy Blaney once worked as a teacher — if so, he will understand what I am about to say. The young man in question did his examinations and got his results. His teacher said that the result of one examination, which the young man had supposedly failed, could not be correct because he was the best in his class at the subject in question. When the result was reviewed, it was discovered that a mistake had been made and the grade was changed to an “A”, rather than a fail. When I asked the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, about it today, she told me she has no responsibility for the matter. Deputy Blaney made a similar comment a moment ago. That is what is wrong with the Government — it takes responsibility for nothing. The country is being run by report, commission and regulation.

Ministers are not responsible for anything anymore. The country is being run by commissioners, regulators and EU officials.

I would like to return to the issue of health. What are we doing with medical cards? People on social welfare do not even qualify anymore, when the rules and regulations are implemented strictly, because the guidelines have not been changed properly in the last few years. We are to have another review. More consultants will be asked to look at the matter. It is very simple — we should increase the limits and look after those who need to be looked after.

It is like another matter I used to raise in the House.

I am sure the scriptwriters have handed the Government Deputies their scripts and they will have to read them. Who wrote Deputy Curran’s script? Which Department is responsible for it? Was it the official in the Chamber? Was it the programme manager? Was it John Dowling? Who wrote it? That is the new thing now.

I want to finish by talking about the carbon tax — the green tax.

It is a tax increase for rural Ireland. I think the carbon tax should be introduced in the cities only because that is where all the carbon is being used. Where I live, there are nothing but potholes on our bad roads. We have no infrastructure and no water and sewerage schemes.

We should have proper roads and proper infrastructure before we start to introduce a carbon tax and an extra road tax.

Instead of having proper train and bus services, we have

It is a bit like the football team in the Minister of State’s county. Mayo has been waiting as long for the Government to look after it as Kildare has been waiting for an All-Ireland.
