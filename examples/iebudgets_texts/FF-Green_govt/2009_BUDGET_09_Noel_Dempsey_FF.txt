<<<<<<< HEAD
I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on Budget 2009, and to outline, in particular, how the transport agenda is being advanced by this budget and how the money allocated to the Department of Transport will be spent in 2009.

In general terms, the gross expenditure provision for the Department in 2009 is €3.6 billion, that is, €2.8 billion for capital projects and €725 million for current spending.

The total Exchequer provision for Transport 21 in 2009 is almost €2.4 billion. This year we will allocate: €1.27 billion for public transport, €2.1 billion on roads, €35 million for the aviation sector and regional airports, and €40 million on road safety. Those are the major expenditure headings of the Department. In addition, some €607 million will be spent on improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads around the country.

I make it clear that provisions have been made to continue work on the critical public transport projects of metro north and the DART interconnector. Despite our more constrained economic circumstances we cannot and will not stop planning and providing future public transport solutions. In this budget, the advanced works plus the planning for metro north and for the DART interconnector continue.

When we launched Transport 21 in 2005 we detailed an ambitious investment programme in our transport infrastructure. The individual projects listed under Transport 21 were excellent projects in 2005. They are still excellent projects today and they will be excellent projects in a few years from now. There is no question of cancelling any of the projects despite the more constrained economic circumstances in which we find ourselves today. However, as our economy has not grown this year in line with our expectations, or indeed anything like it, some of the projects, mainly in the roads area, will have to be rolled out at a slower pace than we had originally intended. That is not ideal and not what we wished. However, it is inevitable in the current difficult economic environment.

In these more difficult times it is important to look at how far we have come in recent years. When we took office in 1997 the total capital provision for national roads and public transport, the equivalent to Transport 21, was €306 million, as opposed to the €2.5 billion now. Just €12 million was being spent by the Exchequer on public transport investment, whereas today we are spending just over €900 million.

That money has been well spent. A great deal has been achieved in the intervening period. We are on track to complete the five major inter-urban motorways by the end of 2010. This involves the construction of almost 750 km of new road, approximately 390 km of which is already open to traffic and the remaining 360 km is at construction. One tangible example of the progress we have made is that it is now possible to travel on continuous motorway from Dundalk to Portlaoise. We have revitalised the railways and rescued them from a slow decline over previous decades. Under the railway safety programme we have renewed the physical infrastructure and strengthened the management of safety. We now have one of the youngest inter-city rail fleets in Europe. We also have one of the fastest growing rail facilities in Europe. As services have improved, the public has responded and passenger numbers have grown substantially. Despite the economic downturn, those figures are remaining static at present. There has been no loss to the railways.

There has been major investment in the Dublin suburban rail network. The capacity of the DART system has almost doubled, the original rolling stock has been refurbished, station [760]platforms have been lengthened and much of the infrastructure has been renewed. There has also been a huge investment in new outer suburban rail stock and an expansion in services. The Luas network has proven exceptionally popular with the travelling public and now carries over 28 million passengers each year.

We have made a large investment in bus services. The fleet has been renewed and Dublin Bus capacity has expanded by over a quarter.

Bus Éireann’s commuter network has seen a major expansion.

I do not believe in sending empty buses around the city streets. We must get value for the money we spend.

The Labour Party should accept that we should not waste public expenditure in good or bad times.

We have made huge strides on improving the accessibility of our public transport system for persons with disabilities. Some 80% of the Dublin Bus fleet will be accessible by the end of this year and approximately one third of bus stops in the greater Dublin area will have been upgraded by then. All of the city bus fleet in the regional cities is 100% low floor and accessible for people with disabilities.

Despite the economic downturn, it is clear that 2009 will be another huge year for transport projects. My aim is to deliver increased public transport passenger capacity. I will ensure that project planning continues to ensure that sufficient projects are ready to start as soon as funding becomes available.

The Deputy would be better off listening than heckling. He might learn something and not make false statements, as he did last night about the Navan rail line and others.

I have endeavoured to continue the planning for all the public transport projects in Transport 21 and bring them to tender stage. None of them that was due to start next year is being postponed. The projects will continue to be planned and designed, and public consultation will continue to take place. They will be brought to tender stage as quickly as possible. I wish to ensure that the five major inter-urban routes are on target for completion by 2010. The €1.27 billion provision this year for public transport will maintain the momentum of our investment programme to date.

In addition, a number of important projects in public transport will be completed next year. Construction of the Luas extension from Connolly Station to Docklands will finish towards the [761]end of the year. Phase one of the western rail corridor from Ennis to Athenry will be completed, allowing for the introduction of an inter-city service from Limerick to Galway and a commuter service from Athenry to Galway and the Cork-Midleton line will reopen, leading to a major extension of commuter rail services in Cork.

It is a commuter service from Athenry to Galway. It is inter-city at the moment.


What we are doing in phase one of the western rail corridor will allow for a commuter service from Athenry to Galway from next year, once it is completed. The western rail corridor is obviously for inter-city services but it will also try to enhance commuter services, such as the existing Ennis-Limerick commuter service.

Investment in bus priority in Dublin and the regional cities will be increased in 2009. I have asked the Dublin local authorities to give particular attention to the elimination of pinch points on the bus network. There are approximately 43 pinch points on the quality bus corridors in Dublin. These have been mapped at my request and a plan is in place to remove them within a two year period. The one thing on which Deputy Broughan and I agree is that efficient and effective bus services will be needed in the short and medium term as work continues on the metro. I am anxious to secure quality bus corridors that actually work and that make it attractive for people to use bus services.

There are sufficient buses to run the services we have at present. In fact, the indications are that they could be run a good deal more efficiently so we could get more bang for our buck. It is not a question, as we have so often been accused of doing by the Opposition, of throwing money, or in this case buses, at the problem.

A number of things must be done including, which I hope the Deputy will support, changed work practices and using the buses we have at present to their full potential. I look forward to the Deputy’s support as we move on that in the next six to 12 months.

[762]Construction of phase one of the Navan rail line and the Citywest Luas extension will get underway shortly, despite the doom and gloom preached in the House last night by Deputy Burton. In 2009 we will continue to work on the Luas extension from Sandyford to Cherrywood; the four-tracking of the Kildare rail line from Cherry Orchard to Hazelhatch, allowing the trebling of passenger capacity on that corridor; the roll-out of the 183 new intercity railcars; and the city centre resignalling project. The latter is vital to the provision of adequate services within the greater Dublin area. Expenditure will continue on a number of ongoing programmes, including the railway safety and accessibility programmes.

Increasing public transport capacity is one of my key priorities. Metro north and the DART interconnector are critical components of the strategy, set out in Transport 21, to transform the public transport system in the greater Dublin area. They will also provide for a great increase in public transport capacity. Metro north is expected to carry 34 million passengers per annum when it opens and will be able to carry more than 200 million passengers per year in the longer term as development occurs along the route. The interconnector will remove a major bottleneck in the Dublin rail system. When it is completed it will facilitate trebling of the passenger capacity of the suburban rail network to more than 100 million passengers per annum.

The Railway Procurement Agency, which is responsible for the project, applied last month to An Bord Pleanála for a railway order for metro north. The application clearly sets out the route alignment, underground and surface sections and station locations. The public private partnership tenders are due to be submitted to the Railway Procurement Agency in early February. Once the procurement and the statutory approval processes are complete, the Government will take a final decision on the project, based on a capital appraisal. This is a long-standing requirement for all very large projects under Transport 21. Once the railway order is in force, the Railway Procurement Agency will be in a position to commence enabling works for the public private partnership project, such as the relocation of utilities. The 2009 Estimates include substantial funding provision for these works.

The total is in the Book of Estimates. I will obtain it for the Deputy and let him know.

A number of enabling works must take place, including the purchase of land. Some of these works are under way. The design cost must continue to be considered.

There was much speculation on whether metro north was to proceed. Deputy Broughan and I had discussions on it in the House and I acknowledged his acceptance of my advice not to raise issues about whether it would go ahead. I thank him for this. However, I have heard much ignorant comment about metro north and questions as to why we do not acquire buses. To do what we want with metro north, that is, to move approximately 20,000 passengers in each direction during peak travel times, we would have to invest in approximately 400 to 500 buses. There would not be sufficient road space to do so. If one were to opt for a Luas solution, as some are advocating, the maximum number of passengers one could accommodate would be approximately 8,000 per hour at peak time. Given that the population is to grow to approximately 500,000 to 600,000 by 2015-16, a Luas or totally bus-based system of public transport in the north County Dublin area is a nonsensical proposition.

[763]If we could do nothing but carry out the metro north and interconnector projects over the next four or five years, we would lay the foundation for a really good public transport system. The investment involved in metro north should not be considered in light of the 30-year period during which we will pay for it under the public private partnership but in light of the fact that the system will serve the needs of the people for 50 or 100 years. This is why I am so committed to making progress.

Planning for the DART interconnector is also continuing and good progress is being made. I have made it clear to CIE that I want to see this progress maintained and, where possible, accelerated. In deference to people in business, particularly in the city centre, I want to minimise the period of disruption and work on both projects together. Deputy Broughan and other Members have raised this with me in the House. CIE is aware of the issue and is making a considerable effort to address it. There are certain areas in which works must be carried out sequentially but others in which they can be carried out simultaneously.

The target is to be ready to submit a railway order application to An Bord Pleanála towards the end of 2009.

The interconnector project only facilitates the expansion of the capacity of the suburban rail network. Other measures are required to deliver that capacity, most particularly the electrification of the wider suburban network and the purchase of new electric rolling stock. Planning for these projects is ongoing. Electrification must be completed before the interconnector is in place and we are committed to achieving this. The 2009 Estimates include a substantial provision for the continuing planning work needed for the railway order application and for the commencement of electrification work.

Buses are another key component of my strategy to increase capacity. I ordered a cost and efficiency review of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann. When that study has been completed and I have considered its findings, I will decide on future bus investment strategy.

It is clear from the commitment to the many public transport projects to which I have referred that there is now a significant shift to more sustainable transport in the Government’s national development plan. This should not come as a surprise to anyone because, when I launched a public consultation document earlier this year, I outlined the Government’s vision of having a sustainable transport system by 2020. I also outlined that, if we continue as we are, travel trends in Ireland will be on a totally unsustainable trajectory.

One could argue that the economic down-turn will solve the transport problem on the grounds that less activity will lead to lower population growth, but that is a short-sighted way of looking at the matter. Transport planning must be carried out over the medium to long term and it is both hopelessly pessimistic and unwise to plan for the future based entirely on the immediate economic difficulties. This is probably the trap we all fell into in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.

In carrying out the public consultation process on the sustainable travel and transport action plan, I was surprised by the extent of the engagement. Nearly 500 thoughtful submissions were received, a much higher response rate than normal, and the issues raised in the consultation document resonated well with the public. People are concerned about the harmful effects of motorised traffic, they recognise that efficient movement of goods is vital for our economy and they are aware that how they travel in the future is one of the most important influences in the quality of their lives.

[764]I have consistently promised to publish the sustainable travel and transport action plan this year to set out a new policy framework for transport to meet the Government’s vision. In setting out the many transport investment projects being delivered in this budget, I reaffirm the priority I and my colleagues attach to getting the new policy framework in place. I intend to bring the draft plan and a proposed national cycle policy before the Government in the coming weeks.

In practical terms, I intend safeguarding the budgets for sustainable travel initiatives in the Vote of my Department. I am maintaining the momentum of the green schools travel initiative, which will target 260,000 school children by 2012 and which will, I hope, result in many of them switching to walking or cycling to get to school. In addition, we have secured €10 million for carbon reduction measures in 2009 related directly to transport. In addition to these sustainable transport initiatives, we have also made provision in this year’s budget for the new Marlborough Street public transport bridge, which will facilitate the metro works.

Virtually all the national road Exchequer provision for 2009 is already contractually committed to the delivery of the projects on the major inter-urban routes. The NRA expects that six major projects, totalling 143 km of dual carriageway road, will open to traffic between now and the end of 2009. These are as follows: the N4, Lucan bypass; the N6, Athlone to Ballinasloe; the N7, Nenagh to Limerick; the N8, Cullahill to Cashel; the N8, Fermoy to Mitchelstown; and the N9, Waterford to Knocktopher. Over €2.5 billion worth of work will continue on 18 major road projects next year, including phase 2 of the M50 upgrade, the Limerick tunnel, the Waterford city bypass, the Castletown to Nenagh section of the N7 and the Kilcullen to Carlow and Carlow to Knocktopher sections of the N9.

All these projects are proceeding on time and on budget and some will come in ahead of time. Over 70% of the major inter-urban network should be open to traffic by the end of next year. In the ten years 2000 to 2010, the State will have invested more than €8 billion in this programme. Already, the Dublin to the Border M1 route was opened to traffic in August 2007 and construction is well under way on the remaining major inter-urban projects.

The 2009 Estimates also include sufficient provision to meet contractual commitments on the various regional airport projects and to meet our share of the cost of the City of Derry Airport. Notwithstanding the difficult financial position, the €2.4 billion of Exchequer capital will allow us to make real and tangible progress in 2009 and to maintain our project planning into the future. In addition to the almost €2.4 billion of capital for Transport 21, over €600 million is being provided for the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads. These roads are a key component of our national infrastructure and play a crucial role in the development of the country and the exploitation of crucial sectors such as tourism. A further €50 million is provided for the maintenance and management of national roads.

I have provided almost €40 million for the Road Safety Authority and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety. The good news about road safety is that what we are doing is working — I acknowledge this is a concern shared across the House.

Today, there are 35 more people alive than this day last year. Road deaths in Ireland dropped by 30% in the period from 1997 to 2007. A total of 472 people lost their lives on our roads in 1997 compared to 339 in 2007. This downward trend, which has thankfully continued this year, was achieved despite the fact that there has been a large increase in the number of drivers and vehicles on our roads.

[765]According to the European road safety performance index programme, the PIN programme, which is run by the European Transport Safety Council, ETSC, Ireland is now ranked in the top ten best performing EU countries for road safety performance. An ETSC report dated 8 October this year found Dublin to be the best performing European capital in reducing road deaths.

On the matter of driving licences and learner drivers, following changes made in the regulations last October, the RSA and I made a commitment that all those on the waiting list on 30 October 2007, estimated to be 122,000 people, would be offered a test by mid-March 2008 and that by the end of June 2008, the waiting time for tests would be down to ten weeks. Both of these commitments were met and every effort will be made to maintain this in 2009.

In response to Deputy Broughan, the RSA budget was more than doubled last year from, I understand, €20 million to €44 million. Some €20 million of this was for new works but €10 million was specifically to clear the backlog. We have cleared the backlog and have managed to maintain this position, and we continue to hold on to a sizeable proportion of the extra funding we got last year for that specific purpose.

Funding for the Coast Guard and maritime administration is being maintained at its 2008 level of almost €44 million. The decision to maintain this level of funding in spite of the financial restrictions reflects the vital nature of the services being provided. These services include the operations of the Coast Guard which entail maintenance of a helicopter marine emergency service at four bases around the country; funding of voluntary services of 55 Coast Guard stations based around the coastline; and a pollution-salvage response programme and related and incidental matters. The Coast Guard maintains a marine radio communications network for marine and inland search and rescue, maritime safety information and vessel communication services.

The Department is the regulatory authority for marine safety and marine environmental protection. The main focus is on accident prevention through an appropriate combination of regulation, a heightening of safety awareness and enforcement. The Department participates at both EU and international level in the development and implementation of safety policies and standards in this area. The Marine Survey Office carries out the initial approval of designs and drawings for new vessels or modifications to existing vessels, and then carries out the necessary surveys.

Provision is also being made for Exchequer grants towards the costs of the Commissioners of Irish Lights under an international agreement with the UK authorities regarding the provision of aids to navigation, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the weather buoys network and Ireland’s obligations under the International LORAN-C agreement on marine navigation. Funding is also being provided for the Marine Casualty Investigation Board. The allocation for 2009 provides for expenditure of €4 million on the Coast Guard’s radio communications for essential upgrading of rescue centre radio communications. Some €27.5 million is being provided for the provision of the search and rescue helicopter services.

The Government is to be commended on its decision to continue to target resources at investment in the country’s economic infrastructure. It is clear evidence of the Government’s commitment to, among other things, the Transport 21 programme and the delivery of a world-class transport system for Ireland. Pursuit of this policy will leave us well placed to take advantage of a recovery in the world economy.

I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on Budget 2009, and to outline, in particular, how the transport agenda is being advanced by this budget and how the money allocated to the Department of Transport will be spent in 2009.

In general terms, the gross expenditure provision for the Department in 2009 is €3.6 billion, that is, €2.8 billion for capital projects and €725 million for current spending.

The total Exchequer provision for Transport 21 in 2009 is almost €2.4 billion. This year we will allocate: €1.27 billion for public transport, €2.1 billion on roads, €35 million for the aviation sector and regional airports, and €40 million on road safety. Those are the major expenditure headings of the Department. In addition, some €607 million will be spent on improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads around the country.

I make it clear that provisions have been made to continue work on the critical public transport projects of metro north and the DART interconnector. Despite our more constrained economic circumstances we cannot and will not stop planning and providing future public transport solutions. In this budget, the advanced works plus the planning for metro north and for the DART interconnector continue.

When we launched Transport 21 in 2005 we detailed an ambitious investment programme in our transport infrastructure. The individual projects listed under Transport 21 were excellent projects in 2005. They are still excellent projects today and they will be excellent projects in a few years from now. There is no question of cancelling any of the projects despite the more constrained economic circumstances in which we find ourselves today. However, as our economy has not grown this year in line with our expectations, or indeed anything like it, some of the projects, mainly in the roads area, will have to be rolled out at a slower pace than we had originally intended. That is not ideal and not what we wished. However, it is inevitable in the current difficult economic environment.

In these more difficult times it is important to look at how far we have come in recent years. When we took office in 1997 the total capital provision for national roads and public transport, the equivalent to Transport 21, was €306 million, as opposed to the €2.5 billion now. Just €12 million was being spent by the Exchequer on public transport investment, whereas today we are spending just over €900 million.

That money has been well spent. A great deal has been achieved in the intervening period. We are on track to complete the five major inter-urban motorways by the end of 2010. This involves the construction of almost 750 km of new road, approximately 390 km of which is already open to traffic and the remaining 360 km is at construction. One tangible example of the progress we have made is that it is now possible to travel on continuous motorway from Dundalk to Portlaoise. We have revitalised the railways and rescued them from a slow decline over previous decades. Under the railway safety programme we have renewed the physical infrastructure and strengthened the management of safety. We now have one of the youngest inter-city rail fleets in Europe. We also have one of the fastest growing rail facilities in Europe. As services have improved, the public has responded and passenger numbers have grown substantially. Despite the economic downturn, those figures are remaining static at present. There has been no loss to the railways.

There has been major investment in the Dublin suburban rail network. The capacity of the DART system has almost doubled, the original rolling stock has been refurbished, station [760]platforms have been lengthened and much of the infrastructure has been renewed. There has also been a huge investment in new outer suburban rail stock and an expansion in services. The Luas network has proven exceptionally popular with the travelling public and now carries over 28 million passengers each year.

We have made a large investment in bus services. The fleet has been renewed and Dublin Bus capacity has expanded by over a quarter.

Bus Éireann’s commuter network has seen a major expansion.

I do not believe in sending empty buses around the city streets. We must get value for the money we spend.

The Labour Party should accept that we should not waste public expenditure in good or bad times.

We have made huge strides on improving the accessibility of our public transport system for persons with disabilities. Some 80% of the Dublin Bus fleet will be accessible by the end of this year and approximately one third of bus stops in the greater Dublin area will have been upgraded by then. All of the city bus fleet in the regional cities is 100% low floor and accessible for people with disabilities.

Despite the economic downturn, it is clear that 2009 will be another huge year for transport projects. My aim is to deliver increased public transport passenger capacity. I will ensure that project planning continues to ensure that sufficient projects are ready to start as soon as funding becomes available.

The Deputy would be better off listening than heckling. He might learn something and not make false statements, as he did last night about the Navan rail line and others.

I have endeavoured to continue the planning for all the public transport projects in Transport 21 and bring them to tender stage. None of them that was due to start next year is being postponed. The projects will continue to be planned and designed, and public consultation will continue to take place. They will be brought to tender stage as quickly as possible. I wish to ensure that the five major inter-urban routes are on target for completion by 2010. The €1.27 billion provision this year for public transport will maintain the momentum of our investment programme to date.

In addition, a number of important projects in public transport will be completed next year. Construction of the Luas extension from Connolly Station to Docklands will finish towards the [761]end of the year. Phase one of the western rail corridor from Ennis to Athenry will be completed, allowing for the introduction of an inter-city service from Limerick to Galway and a commuter service from Athenry to Galway and the Cork-Midleton line will reopen, leading to a major extension of commuter rail services in Cork.

It is a commuter service from Athenry to Galway. It is inter-city at the moment.


What we are doing in phase one of the western rail corridor will allow for a commuter service from Athenry to Galway from next year, once it is completed. The western rail corridor is obviously for inter-city services but it will also try to enhance commuter services, such as the existing Ennis-Limerick commuter service.

Investment in bus priority in Dublin and the regional cities will be increased in 2009. I have asked the Dublin local authorities to give particular attention to the elimination of pinch points on the bus network. There are approximately 43 pinch points on the quality bus corridors in Dublin. These have been mapped at my request and a plan is in place to remove them within a two year period. The one thing on which Deputy Broughan and I agree is that efficient and effective bus services will be needed in the short and medium term as work continues on the metro. I am anxious to secure quality bus corridors that actually work and that make it attractive for people to use bus services.

There are sufficient buses to run the services we have at present. In fact, the indications are that they could be run a good deal more efficiently so we could get more bang for our buck. It is not a question, as we have so often been accused of doing by the Opposition, of throwing money, or in this case buses, at the problem.

A number of things must be done including, which I hope the Deputy will support, changed work practices and using the buses we have at present to their full potential. I look forward to the Deputy’s support as we move on that in the next six to 12 months.

[762]Construction of phase one of the Navan rail line and the Citywest Luas extension will get underway shortly, despite the doom and gloom preached in the House last night by Deputy Burton. In 2009 we will continue to work on the Luas extension from Sandyford to Cherrywood; the four-tracking of the Kildare rail line from Cherry Orchard to Hazelhatch, allowing the trebling of passenger capacity on that corridor; the roll-out of the 183 new intercity railcars; and the city centre resignalling project. The latter is vital to the provision of adequate services within the greater Dublin area. Expenditure will continue on a number of ongoing programmes, including the railway safety and accessibility programmes.

Increasing public transport capacity is one of my key priorities. Metro north and the DART interconnector are critical components of the strategy, set out in Transport 21, to transform the public transport system in the greater Dublin area. They will also provide for a great increase in public transport capacity. Metro north is expected to carry 34 million passengers per annum when it opens and will be able to carry more than 200 million passengers per year in the longer term as development occurs along the route. The interconnector will remove a major bottleneck in the Dublin rail system. When it is completed it will facilitate trebling of the passenger capacity of the suburban rail network to more than 100 million passengers per annum.

The Railway Procurement Agency, which is responsible for the project, applied last month to An Bord Pleanála for a railway order for metro north. The application clearly sets out the route alignment, underground and surface sections and station locations. The public private partnership tenders are due to be submitted to the Railway Procurement Agency in early February. Once the procurement and the statutory approval processes are complete, the Government will take a final decision on the project, based on a capital appraisal. This is a long-standing requirement for all very large projects under Transport 21. Once the railway order is in force, the Railway Procurement Agency will be in a position to commence enabling works for the public private partnership project, such as the relocation of utilities. The 2009 Estimates include substantial funding provision for these works.

The total is in the Book of Estimates. I will obtain it for the Deputy and let him know.

A number of enabling works must take place, including the purchase of land. Some of these works are under way. The design cost must continue to be considered.

There was much speculation on whether metro north was to proceed. Deputy Broughan and I had discussions on it in the House and I acknowledged his acceptance of my advice not to raise issues about whether it would go ahead. I thank him for this. However, I have heard much ignorant comment about metro north and questions as to why we do not acquire buses. To do what we want with metro north, that is, to move approximately 20,000 passengers in each direction during peak travel times, we would have to invest in approximately 400 to 500 buses. There would not be sufficient road space to do so. If one were to opt for a Luas solution, as some are advocating, the maximum number of passengers one could accommodate would be approximately 8,000 per hour at peak time. Given that the population is to grow to approximately 500,000 to 600,000 by 2015-16, a Luas or totally bus-based system of public transport in the north County Dublin area is a nonsensical proposition.

[763]If we could do nothing but carry out the metro north and interconnector projects over the next four or five years, we would lay the foundation for a really good public transport system. The investment involved in metro north should not be considered in light of the 30-year period during which we will pay for it under the public private partnership but in light of the fact that the system will serve the needs of the people for 50 or 100 years. This is why I am so committed to making progress.

Planning for the DART interconnector is also continuing and good progress is being made. I have made it clear to CIE that I want to see this progress maintained and, where possible, accelerated. In deference to people in business, particularly in the city centre, I want to minimise the period of disruption and work on both projects together. Deputy Broughan and other Members have raised this with me in the House. CIE is aware of the issue and is making a considerable effort to address it. There are certain areas in which works must be carried out sequentially but others in which they can be carried out simultaneously.

The target is to be ready to submit a railway order application to An Bord Pleanála towards the end of 2009.

The interconnector project only facilitates the expansion of the capacity of the suburban rail network. Other measures are required to deliver that capacity, most particularly the electrification of the wider suburban network and the purchase of new electric rolling stock. Planning for these projects is ongoing. Electrification must be completed before the interconnector is in place and we are committed to achieving this. The 2009 Estimates include a substantial provision for the continuing planning work needed for the railway order application and for the commencement of electrification work.

Buses are another key component of my strategy to increase capacity. I ordered a cost and efficiency review of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann. When that study has been completed and I have considered its findings, I will decide on future bus investment strategy.

It is clear from the commitment to the many public transport projects to which I have referred that there is now a significant shift to more sustainable transport in the Government’s national development plan. This should not come as a surprise to anyone because, when I launched a public consultation document earlier this year, I outlined the Government’s vision of having a sustainable transport system by 2020. I also outlined that, if we continue as we are, travel trends in Ireland will be on a totally unsustainable trajectory.

One could argue that the economic down-turn will solve the transport problem on the grounds that less activity will lead to lower population growth, but that is a short-sighted way of looking at the matter. Transport planning must be carried out over the medium to long term and it is both hopelessly pessimistic and unwise to plan for the future based entirely on the immediate economic difficulties. This is probably the trap we all fell into in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.

In carrying out the public consultation process on the sustainable travel and transport action plan, I was surprised by the extent of the engagement. Nearly 500 thoughtful submissions were received, a much higher response rate than normal, and the issues raised in the consultation document resonated well with the public. People are concerned about the harmful effects of motorised traffic, they recognise that efficient movement of goods is vital for our economy and they are aware that how they travel in the future is one of the most important influences in the quality of their lives.

[764]I have consistently promised to publish the sustainable travel and transport action plan this year to set out a new policy framework for transport to meet the Government’s vision. In setting out the many transport investment projects being delivered in this budget, I reaffirm the priority I and my colleagues attach to getting the new policy framework in place. I intend to bring the draft plan and a proposed national cycle policy before the Government in the coming weeks.

In practical terms, I intend safeguarding the budgets for sustainable travel initiatives in the Vote of my Department. I am maintaining the momentum of the green schools travel initiative, which will target 260,000 school children by 2012 and which will, I hope, result in many of them switching to walking or cycling to get to school. In addition, we have secured €10 million for carbon reduction measures in 2009 related directly to transport. In addition to these sustainable transport initiatives, we have also made provision in this year’s budget for the new Marlborough Street public transport bridge, which will facilitate the metro works.

Virtually all the national road Exchequer provision for 2009 is already contractually committed to the delivery of the projects on the major inter-urban routes. The NRA expects that six major projects, totalling 143 km of dual carriageway road, will open to traffic between now and the end of 2009. These are as follows: the N4, Lucan bypass; the N6, Athlone to Ballinasloe; the N7, Nenagh to Limerick; the N8, Cullahill to Cashel; the N8, Fermoy to Mitchelstown; and the N9, Waterford to Knocktopher. Over €2.5 billion worth of work will continue on 18 major road projects next year, including phase 2 of the M50 upgrade, the Limerick tunnel, the Waterford city bypass, the Castletown to Nenagh section of the N7 and the Kilcullen to Carlow and Carlow to Knocktopher sections of the N9.

All these projects are proceeding on time and on budget and some will come in ahead of time. Over 70% of the major inter-urban network should be open to traffic by the end of next year. In the ten years 2000 to 2010, the State will have invested more than €8 billion in this programme. Already, the Dublin to the Border M1 route was opened to traffic in August 2007 and construction is well under way on the remaining major inter-urban projects.

The 2009 Estimates also include sufficient provision to meet contractual commitments on the various regional airport projects and to meet our share of the cost of the City of Derry Airport. Notwithstanding the difficult financial position, the €2.4 billion of Exchequer capital will allow us to make real and tangible progress in 2009 and to maintain our project planning into the future. In addition to the almost €2.4 billion of capital for Transport 21, over €600 million is being provided for the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads. These roads are a key component of our national infrastructure and play a crucial role in the development of the country and the exploitation of crucial sectors such as tourism. A further €50 million is provided for the maintenance and management of national roads.

I have provided almost €40 million for the Road Safety Authority and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety. The good news about road safety is that what we are doing is working — I acknowledge this is a concern shared across the House.

Today, there are 35 more people alive than this day last year. Road deaths in Ireland dropped by 30% in the period from 1997 to 2007. A total of 472 people lost their lives on our roads in 1997 compared to 339 in 2007. This downward trend, which has thankfully continued this year, was achieved despite the fact that there has been a large increase in the number of drivers and vehicles on our roads.

[765]According to the European road safety performance index programme, the PIN programme, which is run by the European Transport Safety Council, ETSC, Ireland is now ranked in the top ten best performing EU countries for road safety performance. An ETSC report dated 8 October this year found Dublin to be the best performing European capital in reducing road deaths.

On the matter of driving licences and learner drivers, following changes made in the regulations last October, the RSA and I made a commitment that all those on the waiting list on 30 October 2007, estimated to be 122,000 people, would be offered a test by mid-March 2008 and that by the end of June 2008, the waiting time for tests would be down to ten weeks. Both of these commitments were met and every effort will be made to maintain this in 2009.

In response to Deputy Broughan, the RSA budget was more than doubled last year from, I understand, €20 million to €44 million. Some €20 million of this was for new works but €10 million was specifically to clear the backlog. We have cleared the backlog and have managed to maintain this position, and we continue to hold on to a sizeable proportion of the extra funding we got last year for that specific purpose.

Funding for the Coast Guard and maritime administration is being maintained at its 2008 level of almost €44 million. The decision to maintain this level of funding in spite of the financial restrictions reflects the vital nature of the services being provided. These services include the operations of the Coast Guard which entail maintenance of a helicopter marine emergency service at four bases around the country; funding of voluntary services of 55 Coast Guard stations based around the coastline; and a pollution-salvage response programme and related and incidental matters. The Coast Guard maintains a marine radio communications network for marine and inland search and rescue, maritime safety information and vessel communication services.

The Department is the regulatory authority for marine safety and marine environmental protection. The main focus is on accident prevention through an appropriate combination of regulation, a heightening of safety awareness and enforcement. The Department participates at both EU and international level in the development and implementation of safety policies and standards in this area. The Marine Survey Office carries out the initial approval of designs and drawings for new vessels or modifications to existing vessels, and then carries out the necessary surveys.

Provision is also being made for Exchequer grants towards the costs of the Commissioners of Irish Lights under an international agreement with the UK authorities regarding the provision of aids to navigation, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the weather buoys network and Ireland’s obligations under the International LORAN-C agreement on marine navigation. Funding is also being provided for the Marine Casualty Investigation Board. The allocation for 2009 provides for expenditure of €4 million on the Coast Guard’s radio communications for essential upgrading of rescue centre radio communications. Some €27.5 million is being provided for the provision of the search and rescue helicopter services.

The Government is to be commended on its decision to continue to target resources at investment in the country’s economic infrastructure. It is clear evidence of the Government’s commitment to, among other things, the Transport 21 programme and the delivery of a world-class transport system for Ireland. Pursuit of this policy will leave us well placed to take advantage of a recovery in the world economy.
