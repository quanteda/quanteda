The budget measures which were introduced this week by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, constitute a necessary response to the serious economic downturn Ireland is experiencing. The budget represents the best possible way of tackling the challenges we face within the limited resources available to us for the coming year. It has been devised to place the public finances on a stable and sustainable path. It will protect the most vulnerable people in society from the expenditure adjustments which have to be made. The Government will continue to invest in a way that leads to sustainable economic development. When this country faced similar circumstances 20 years ago, Charles Haughey was Taoiseach and Ray MacSharry was Minister for Finance.

They took the tough decisions which needed to be taken then.

I will speak about Alan Dukes. I am more than happy to give him the credit he deserves. Some of Deputy Hogan’s colleagues might not have been happy to do that at the time.

Tough decisions needed to be taken at that time.

They were taken.

Alan Dukes was Leader of the Opposition 20 years ago. He recognised the difficult position the country was in. He understood what was at stake. He supported the Government’s strategy, in principle. The personal sacrifices he was making were not appreciated by many of his colleagues at the time.

He did what was right for the country. The decisions which were made then were not fully appreciated until long after they were implemented.

There can be no argument about the fact the actions of that time laid the foundation for much of the success we enjoyed in the following years.

Fine Gael’s approach at that time contrasts with the position it is taking now. The Leader of the Opposition is making policy on the hoof. When he was on his way to a press conference last week, he heard the Government was planning to reduce ministerial wages by 10%.

Deputy Kenny decided there and then he would offer to sacrifice 5% of his own salary.

That put his colleagues in an awkward position.

We need to be sensible about this. I do not expect any response or reaction from the Deputies opposite because they are embarrassed about what has happened.

Deputy Kenny should have consulted his party before making any decision. I know how the Deputies on the Fine Gael benches feel about this matter. They do not need to come here and try to put on a different front.

Many of them were embarrassed.

[90]They did not know what to do about it. Deputy Kenny likes to make policy on the hoof.

As Minister of State with responsibility for natural resources, I recently learned of the discovery of a new species of wasp in the west of Ireland. We are going to call it the Kenny wasp because——

——it has no sting.

We need leadership of the type displayed by Alan Dukes 20 years ago. One would think the current Leader of the Opposition would do something similar.

We do not need any bailing out.

I listened to the speech Deputy Kenny made yesterday.

Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition criticised every decision that had been announced by the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in the previous day’s budget.

I expect constructive criticism from the Opposition.

When one is in government, one does not mind listening to such criticism because it is part and parcel of the job. However, one expects the Opposition to make some real proposals for dealing with matters of this nature.

It is unfortunate. If ever a man deserved to be left in opposition, it is Deputy Kenny.

[91]He has won that crown over recent weeks. The Government has had to make difficult decisions on expenditure and tax. It has decided to maintain investment in certain key productive areas. Such investment will continue in the sectors of communications, energy and natural resources. My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has given the House details of vital investment projects in areas like energy efficiency, renewable energy and broadband.

The projects will play a major role in promoting sustainable development and competitiveness. Ireland is not alone in facing a severe economic downturn. As a small open economy, it is particularly vulnerable to the downturn. The Government is tackling the challenges we face in a prompt and decisive manner. It is asking everyone in Ireland to make a sacrifice, which we hope will be of a temporary nature. The Government has shown leadership in this regard. It is natural that tough decisions will create certain hardships for people. There are no easy solutions in these difficult times. It has been necessary to take steps to achieve savings in the 2008 and 2009 budgets of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and its agencies. The 2009 allocations demand that certain efficiencies be achieved in the area of current expenditure. These efficiencies will be delivered to ensure we live within our budget. I acknowledge the responsible role that has been played by the Green Party in recent times. As Deputies are aware, this is the Green Party’s first experience of government. It has had to take tough decisions and live with them. I am sure some of those decisions have not pleased its supporters. I acknowledge that it has done what is right, in the national interest.

Members are aware that the Government has decided to restructure certain State agencies. Under the restructuring programme, the central and regional fisheries boards are to be replaced by a single national fisheries authority, in line with a recommendation made in the 2005 Farrell Grant Sparks report on the fisheries sector. This measure will promote greater flexibility in the use of inland fisheries resources and maintain a regional focus on such matters. The rationalisation will strengthen this valuable sector, which plays an important role as the guardian of our inland fisheries’ environment. Attention must turn immediately to the implementation of the Government’s policies in this area. It is obvious that such implementation will require new primary legislation, which will be drafted and enacted as soon as possible. In the meantime, the Minister and I want interim steps to be taken with a view to providing for a smooth transition to the new structure. I assure staff that the new structures will be designed to consolidate and strengthen the service and improve its efficiency and effectiveness. Discussions on the implementation of this Government decision, and its implications, will take place in due course. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I will meet the chief executive officers of the fisheries boards tomorrow to initiate the transition process.

I wish to mention the salmon hardship scheme in the context of the inland fisheries budget. By the end of this year, over €24 million will have been paid out under the scheme. The allocation for the scheme in the Department’s 2009 Vote is €4.7 million. When the payments which are due in 2010 are made, the €30 million hardship fund that was established by the Government will have been brought to a successful conclusion. I am pleased this year’s budget makes provision for the continuation of the national seabed survey, known as the INFOMAR project. The survey, which is being undertaken by committed and dedicated people, is producing valuable and useful information. This important strategic programme provides vital baseline mapping for a range of offshore initiatives, such as the marine renewable energy developments which are supported by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. It underpins activities such as offshore exploration, fisheries, aquaculture, aggregates and [92]safety. This project is acknowledged as being best practice worldwide and is carried out by the Geological Survey of Ireland in conjunction with the Marine Institute. It has been run very efficiently and within budget for its first three years. It is the envy of many countries around the world and we are aware of several that are trying to replicate what we are doing here.

As Minister of State with responsibility for the knowledge society, I am acutely aware of the importance of encouraging people to participate in the knowledge society. What we call “e-inclusion” has the potential to be positive in many ways. Information and communication technologies have transformed the lives of many people and they make it easier, quicker and sometimes cheaper to access services. If we are to ensure that this country thrives again, it is necessary that we use information and communication technology in the best and most efficient way possible. As we develop such technology, it is important to ensure that nobody is left behind and that it is made available to everyone. That is why we are keen to see the roll out of broadband around the country.

Only 18% of Irish people between 65 and 74 have used the Internet. Older people represent a key group that is in danger of being left behind in the knowledge society, and most do not have the experience of using technology and are not in a position to pay bills, book tickets on-line or avail of other advantages like the rest of us. Many of these people do not realise the extent of the potential benefits they are missing. That is something we want to change and I acknowledge the tremendous contribution that voluntary organisations are making around the country in educating older people in this area. We will be more than happy to continue our support for them in providing this technology.
