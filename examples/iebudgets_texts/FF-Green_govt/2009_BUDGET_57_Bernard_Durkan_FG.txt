I welcome the Minister for Finance back to the House. I am sure he was taking the reaction to the budget in the community and on the European scene. I know there is some considerable turmoil outside the House but there has been turmoil here today too. Confusion exists about some of the budget’s provisions and I hope the Minister will shed some light on them.

“Health cuts hurt the elderly, the sick and the handicapped” was an election slogan some years ago. It was before the Minister first entered the House so I cannot accuse him of drawing up the slogan. However, he and his colleagues have been the beneficiaries of an electoral advantage gained from policies pursued over the past seven years. One of the Minister’s predecessors, Charlie McCreevy, knew before the 2002 general election of the spree in public spending. However, he could not arrest it until after the general election. I remember the pilgrimage to the plinth from the backbenchers on that side of the House to protest at the callousness of the then Minister for Finance as he attempted to haul the public finances into proper kilter. He failed and that is where it all went wrong six years ago. The Government can claim all it likes that these current public finance problems are all part of an international crisis. While it [138]is an added difficulty, these problems originated in this country. Some of the remedies proposed will cause further difficulties.

I have every respect for the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with responsibility for housing, Deputy Michael Finneran. Any attempt, however, to off-load over-priced housing on to the already hard-pressed consumer will simply be regurgitated in 18 months as negative equity. That is a dangerous route to follow. I accept there are compelling reasons to tackle housing such as the large number of people on local authority housing lists. Over the past several years large numbers of people could have availed of housing but were not facilitated. If they had been, we would not have the bank of closed down building sites as we now have in my constituency and in the Minister’s.

When this House adjourned last week we anticipated some speculation over the weekend but I am sure that neither the Ceann Comhairle nor I, nor the House in general, fully anticipated and appreciated the extent of that speculation and to where it would lead.

As we sat in this Chamber last Thursday evening, when poor Deputy McGrath and others were wondering what their next move might be, Deputy Behan made his move and decided to set them all offside. The offside flag went up and it was too late at that stage for anybody else to move. I am sorry they were consigned to dry dock in such a way. After all, it is only a few short days since all the Government backbenchers and supporters on the benches opposite stood up with one accord and applauded the budget. It was an extraordinary performance.

A standing ovation that lasted for seven minutes. I wondered what all the cheering was about because there was nothing in the budget about which to cheer. There was nothing in it that was reassuring and nothing for elderly people who were about to have their medical cards withdrawn. There was nothing to cheer about so I do not know why the people across the House were cheering. There was nothing for the younger people because [320]a levy was imposed across the board, right down to those on a basic minimum wage. What prompted the backbenchers to react in that hysterical fashion in the course of the budget debate?

I believe this was the first time such a thing happened. The Ceann Comhairle, who is an experienced Member of this House, will appreciate that more than anybody else. Turkeys have been known to approach Christmas with a certain amount of trepidation in the past but on this occasion there was none of that. Children and the mothers of children——

It would not be a good idea to try to have an interview with them, in any event.

Let us examine the other reasons the Government backbenchers might have cheered. What about the mothers of children who are to have their child benefit removed when their children reach 18 years of age? This is at a time when education is under pressure and, although higher education grants remain the same, registration fees have gone up. Income thresholds have not been lifted sufficiently to cater for the situations that now arise. Therefore, it could not have been the mothers of children or the children on whose behalf the Government backbenchers reacted with such enthusiasm.

I was amazed, and I could see the incredulity on the face of the Ceann Comhairle because I am sure he, too, never saw anything like that in his time in the House. It was definitely the first time. As was said long ago in a poem: “Even the ranks of Tuscany could scarce forbear to cheer”. I just do not know why they cheered. All I can conclude is that the Government backbenchers were delirious at the time. They were completely taken over by a kind of euphoria, an upsurge and a welling up in their hearts and minds, because it was a great day.

However, nothing could have been further from the truth. As I said the other evening, these events did not start during the past week, month, six months or the past two or three years. They began during the past eight years. Do we remember all the things that were said to us and about us? We were told the fundamentals were good and if anybody suggested that the economy was going wrong, that person was wrong, hysterical and scaremongering. That person was unpatriotic and talking down the economy.

What was happening across the floor of the House? Why did somebody on that side not ask the obvious question about whether everything was really going all right? Was it right to have 120% and 130% mortgages for first-time buyers or for any buyer? Was it right to have the degree of investment and speculation in the construction industry that was clearly taking place? Why was benchmarking introduced all those years ago? The answer is simple — the pay agreement entered into a year or 18 months before had gone done the tubes. The cost of living had caught up with everybody and the only thing to do was to find some way of getting some money to assuage the general unease in the minds and hearts of the public at that particular time. It was an appalling decision but it was not the decision itself that was wrong, but the reasons for which it had to be taken. Those reasons should have been questioned at that time but were not.

Members on the Opposition benches raised those issues but were told that we were scaremongering, that we had no imagination, that this was a new type of economic thinking and that [321]all was bound to be fine. Were we not the strongest and richest country in the world and one of the most influential? What a load of rubbish that was. Surely we can cop ourselves on and not go on with this type of delusional nonsense in the future.

As to those Government backbenchers who rose up last week, as if in rebellion, and applauded and stomped their feet loudly to the tune of the conclusion of the budget speech, I presume they were not taking responsibility for what had happened. However, somebody, somewhere, must take that responsibility. It is important in the country’s interests that somebody takes that responsibility and does so soon. It is no good if the Government barracks the Opposition and complains that its members are not realistic, or if it suggests that the Opposition has been at fault in some way. The Opposition’s job is, as always, to challenge the Government, to prosecute it and to make sure that we stand up for the people outside the House and raise their concerns and questions even before they are raised in the public arena. That is the important thing, as the Ceann Comhairle will know well.

It was very sad that nobody wanted to take responsibility. Everything in the garden was rosy and there was nothing but the smell of roses in the air as the Government and the country careered in a particular direction. From my knowledge, and from my time in this House, I cannot believe that we have got to where we are nor the means by which we got here without any recognition on the other side of the House as to what was happening. The problem is of so great a magnitude.

The other thing that annoys me, as I am sure it annoys the Ceann Comhairle and other Members of the House, is the suggestion that the problem was imported, that international currency fluctuations caused it all. This is not the case because 95% of the problem originated in this country and was within the ambit of Government, the Financial Regulator, the banking system and the Central Bank to control. It was well within their reach had they wished to control it, but nobody wanted to. It was as if there would be no tomorrow, as if everybody said: “This is great, we are going to have a really great time.” The feel good factor began to break out all over, but that did not last.

At this juncture, as we review the likely impact of this budget on the economy and as Deputies Enda Kenny, Richard Bruton, Eamon Gilmore and others suggest, it looks as if this is only a temporary bandage put on the economy to stop it from rolling over the cliff. All the impositions on the public are there merely to punish the people but the question is, for what are they being punished? They were not responsible for what has happened but they are about to be punished. Unfortunately, ordinary members of the public are about to be punished left, right and centre for the actions of the Government and the banking system. Despite having had no hand, act or part in the fiasco, they will carry responsibility for wrongdoing in the banking sector.

It is a good job the tent at Ballybrit has been closed because it would have been great fun if it had been open this week.

It is grossly unfair that children, people aged over 70 years and those on hospital waiting lists will be punished. On the issue of hospitals and the delivery of health services, I am sick to the back teeth of listening to the Minister for Health and Children tell us that it is economically preferable to take this or that approach. I am also sick of hearing about centres of excellence and long waiting times for services. What has gone wrong with the delivery of health services for members of the public? In recent weeks, I had occasion to speak to a 95 year old man who [322]had to sit on a chair for 24 hours before receiving attention in a well known Dublin hospital. That is how good health services are being delivered.

We do not need rocket science but simply someone to get a grip and do something to address the glaring faults in the system. When the Government decides to address the problem in our health services it must take a meaningful, humane approach which recognises the need to provide services for people when they are vulnerable. We do not need a conveyor belt system under which people receive treatment having waited for up to four years.

I never understood the reason the issue of public housing was included in partnership negotiations seven, eight or ten years ago. Housing has nothing to do with partnership and should not have been dragged from the public arena into the partnership process where those involved are not accustomed to dealing with the issue. A range of ideas was trotted out concerning the way in which the housing sector would develop. We were told, for example, the Irish tradition of home ownership was a whimsical notion about which we should not be concerned as people all over the world were happy to rent their homes. Moreover, everybody would have access to housing through the rental system. As I predicted at the time, renting soon became as expensive as buying and those who were renting were paying the equivalent of a mortgage in any event. I could not understand the logic of the original argument put forward by some of those involved in the property sector, members of the Government and others who should have known better.

It is appalling that a generation of young people has been consigned to renting property in a market which is being artificially propped up. These young people are destined to remain in this market until such time as prices fall and come within their reach. If some people have their way, however, prices will not fall and they will swing in the market for another five or six years. The Government failed the younger generation by completely ignoring their housing needs. To fund their housing needs people found it necessary to borrow sums for 45 and 50 years or secure loans of 120% of the price of the property. Agencies will deny such loans were provided even though 150% loans were provided in some cases, as becomes clear when one considers that on some sites property prices increased by up to €50,000 within a 12-hour period. The Government stands indicted of failing to attempt to deliver to this sector.

In recent years, Government Deputies have loudly boasted about the large increases in social welfare payments awarded in budgets. They scathingly refer to the last Social Welfare Act introduced by the former Minister for Social Welfare, Mr. Proinsias De Rossa.

I am glad Deputy Kennedy has piped up. After ten years of what is alleged to have been the greatest era of development in the history of the State, the Government has awarded a 3% increase in social welfare payments, which is equivalent to the rate of increase introduced by Mr. De Rossa in 1997 when there was good reason to limit it. Government Deputies who in recent years boasted that the Government was acting like Santa Claus should have known this day was approaching because the relevant information was available to them.

When the Taoiseach informed the House that the Opposition promised A, B and C during the most recent general election campaign, he failed to mention that the Government had all the facts and figures at its disposal. It had inside information whereas the Opposition had second-hand information. The Government’s intention was clearly to get past the general election and it succeeded using a stroke of genius. The figures available at the time were misleading and continued to be misleading until a couple of weeks ago. Even today, the Opposition cannot [323]be certain that the information it receives is accurate. The Minister for Finance was unable to assure the House about the veracity of information on the banking system and is unlikely to be able to do so in the next couple of weeks. However, that information will emerge in time.

Is it not appalling that after the so-called Celtic tiger era our schools continue to have prefabricated structures in which, in some cases, the parents and grandparents of the current generation of school children were educated. After ten years of the Celtic tiger roaring in the concrete jungle, the Government has nothing more to offer young children than the same prefabricated structures and overcrowded classes. This is in direct conflict with the promises made by Government parties during and in the aftermath of the general election campaign.

Unfortunately, for reasons of time I am unable to discuss the motions as they relate to other Departments.
