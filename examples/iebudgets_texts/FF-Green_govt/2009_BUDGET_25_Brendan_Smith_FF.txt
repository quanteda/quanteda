In preparing the 2009 Estimates for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, my approach has been to focus available resources on measures that allow us to maintain and grow the productive capacity of the agri-food sector. That involved making choices, some of them difficult, but the choices I have made will facilitate the continued strategic development of the agri-food sector.

Notwithstanding the current economic difficulties, the total expenditure by the Department in 2009, in support of the agriculture, fisheries, food and forestry sectors will be more than €3.2 billion. This high level of investment reflects my commitment and that of the Government to the bio-sector and our recognition of it as one of the most important indigenous manufacturing elements in our economy, both from an employment point of view and as a major contributor to regional development.

In addition to the significant amounts of money that are continuing to be invested in agriculture by the Government in 2009, I am particularly pleased that the Minister for Finance has recognised the value of several tax reliefs to the sector and that he has renewed these measures, notwithstanding the pressures on him. The renewal of these measures is further evidence of the Government’s commitment to the development of a competitive agri-food sector at a time when it can play a pivotal role in helping to address global food security concerns.

It is perhaps ironic that at this time of global economic downturn, the prospects for agricultural commodities on world markets are good. Currently, prices for a wide range of commodities, particularly dairy and some cereals, are higher than they have been for many years and there is general agreement that in the medium term, at least, prices are unlikely to return to their historically low levels.

As Ireland is a major food producing and exporting economy, this is good news for the agriculture and food sector and presents us with opportunities into the future. It is precisely for this reason that I have targeted my Department’s resources in 2009 at the most productive elements of the sector to ensure that it continues to prosper and continues towards achievement of its full potential.

The Department operates a wide range of schemes and services, all of which came under scrutiny in the preparation of next year’s Estimates. I undertook a thorough review of all such schemes before choosing those for which I could prioritise funding. The Department’s single biggest and, perhaps, flagship scheme is the Rural Environmental Protection Scheme, REPS, which has some 60,000 participants. I place a particular value on this scheme that meets environmental imperatives and consumer demands. Accordingly, I decided to maintain the scheme in full and have provided additional funding that brings next year’s expenditure to €355 million, an increase of 7%. Between 2000 and 2009, the Department will have invested €2.25 billion in funding to REPS participants. This additional funding ensures full payment to those already contracted under both REPS 2 and 3, who opt to see out their existing contracts, as well as those new applicants to REPS 4, who undertake new five-year commitments, and those transferring from REPS 2 and 3. REPS 4 payments include a 17% increase in payment rates.

I have also ensured that commitment entered into in partnership to spend €250 million on a suckler welfare scheme is fully honoured. Such was the success of the scheme that the levels of participation exceeded all expectation. This year’s level of participation, at a premium rate [826]of €80 per head, will cost the Department €77 million. It will be necessary to correct the premium rate over the remaining four years of the scheme, but I am committed to the payment of the remaining €173 million over the remaining life of the scheme. The premium rate in the remaining years will depend on the participation rate and at current levels, the premium may have to be reduced by up to half. In respect of 2009, all payments that would ordinarily fall to be paid in late November 2009 will be delayed slightly until early January 2010.

Forestry is a particularly important sector, not least in providing important income to farmers and employment in rural areas as well as contributing significantly to meeting the challenge of climate change. The 2009 Estimate provides €127.7 million for the sector. While, more than €80 million will be directed to payments of premia, mostly to farmers, there will also be generous support for planting and support schemes. The level of funding provided should allow planting to be maintained close to this year’s level.

I have also restated my commitment and that of the Government to support the Irish fishing sector through the provision of €30 million, which does not include the funding provided to Bord lascaigh Mhara, with particular prioritised investment in fish processing, aquaculture development and fishery harbours.

Unfortunately, my commitment to the schemes to which I have referred must come at some price and I have, therefore, reluctantly decided to reduce expenditure under the scheme of area-based compensatory payments. The provision for that scheme next year is being reduced to €220.4 million. However, this reduction will be targeted through reducing the maximum hectarage limit on which payments are to be made from 45 to 34 hectares and through a modest increase in the stocking density requirement, a requirement which has been advocated by some farm representatives for some time. Based simply on the reduction in the maximum hectarage to 34 hectares, some 67,000 of the 102,000 participants will experience no reduction in their payments. The modest increase in the stocking density requirement will have an impact on a further small number of scheme participants.

I have also chosen to temporarily suspend entry to both the early retirement and young farmer installation schemes with immediate effect.

While there have been a healthy number of applications under the installation scheme this year, applications for the early retirement scheme are relatively modest. However, it is worth making the point that all current participants in the scheme will be paid and applications received to date will be processed and next year almost €57 million is being provided to meet current commitments.

In his budget speech yesterday, the Minister for Finance specifically referred to the renewal of several tax reliefs of benefit to the farming sector. Several reliefs specifically targeted at new entrants are particularly welcome, especially given the notable increase in the number of young people entering agricultural college over the past two years and renewed optimism in the sector. Of particular value is the extension of young trained farmers’ stamp duty relief for four years until the end of 2012. This was a significant component of Macra na Feirme’s pre-budget submission and is aimed at bringing about a level of stability and security to families planning and organising early farm transfers. This relief is estimated to be worth €53 million in a full year.

The top rate of stamp duty on agricultural land transactions has been reduced from 9% to 6% on agricultural land transactions above €80,000. This should help reduce the purchase cost for buyers and make transactions more affordable.

[827]Also of benefit to young farmers is the renewal of the 100% rate of stock relief which is useful for young farmers building up the value of their herds. The general 25% rate of stock relief for all farmers was also renewed. Both these reliefs were renewed for a period of two years until 31 December 2010 at an estimated cost of €2 million per year.

Stamp duty relief for farm consolidation is renewed for a two-year period until the end of June 2011. The relief is aimed at farmers reducing their farm fragmentation through the purchase and sale of parcels of land in accordance with the appropriate guidelines. The accelerated rate of capital allowances has also been renewed for a further two years allowing a write-off period of three years and a floating allowance of the lesser of 50% of qualifying expenditure or €31,750 in any one year. This measure is estimated to be worth €10 million in a full year. This broad range of budget measures are aimed at supporting improvements in farm structures by encouraging new entrants, farm consolidation and mobility. Combined, these cost-efficient measures are estimated to be worth more than €65 million in total in a full year.

There has been much comment over the past 24 hours on public service reform, much of it uninformed and incorrect. The public service is not immune from the decisions that have to be taken at this time. The grants-in-aid to the State bodies under the Department’s aegis, namely Teagasc, Bord Bia, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Marine Institute and the SFPA, are being reduced to take account, in particular, of the need to achieve payroll and other efficiency savings. These savings must be seen against what was a significant increase in funding to these organisations in recent years. Next year, I will provide €235 million to them to support agricultural, fisheries, food and forestry activities and I will ask them to prioritise their activities in the light of the current budgetary position and having regard to overall policy for the sector.

In addition, the salaries provision for my Department will require a further fall in staff numbers of 150 by the end of next year. This is in addition to a reduction of almost 500 in recent years and my Department is engaged actively in a programme of reviews aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness with which we provide such a wide range of services to all our stakeholders. It is no more than the taxpayer deserves.

The agri-food sector is of central importance to our economy. Success will be achieved by reliance on quality, innovative and sustainable food production. We have many natural advantages in food production and have developed a sophisticated food industry. The opportunities now emerging for us as a food producing country are there to be grasped. I assure the House that, for its part, the Government realises the potential of the sector.

Notwithstanding the severe budgetary pressures, through Exchequer and EU funding, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will invest €3.2 billion in support of the agriculture, fisheries, food and forestry sectors next year. In addition, the Minister for Finance has also committed to the renewal of tax relief worth €65 million for a further period of two years in most cases and four years in one case to which I earlier referred which was made at the request of Macra na Feirme. I am also particularly pleased that the Minister has confirmed that the possibility of further measures specifically targeted at young farmers will be considered in the context of the forthcoming Finance Bill.

Despite suggestions to the contrary, the Government’s level of commitment to and investment in agriculture is significant and recognises the role the sector has to play and the enormous contribution it makes to the Irish economy. My approach is targeted at the specific intention of protecting the sector’s most productive elements and ensuring that it continues to prosper. That approach requires choices to be made and a balance to be struck. I am satisfied that the choices I have made are the right ones and in the best interests of the Irish agri-food sector at this time.
