I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak today on the budget. Before I do, however, I wish to speak briefly about the medical card issue on which, it appears to me, there was a great deal of play acting. I regret that confusion arose between last week and early this week until the matter was cleared up. However, two characteristics of the main Opposition parties were absent in terms of the manner in which they dealt with this debate.

I will deal first with the Labour Party, members of which may want to respond to what I have to say. As I understand it, the Labour Party represents socialism, the essence of which is that those who deserve something get it, and those who do not deserve it do not. This allows one to target scarce resources at those most in need. I understood that to be the essence of socialism. It appears this is no longer the case because the Labour Party now wishes everybody over the age of 70 years to get a medical card, regardless of means.

Deputy Pat Rabbitte stated that he doubted there were 25,000 millionaires in Ireland. I am not a millionaire but I earn enough to ensure I do not need a medical card, a position I am glad to be in. I hope many others are in the position of being able to afford to meet their own medical expenses. I deserve no credit in this regard. I told the truth and was not the butt of endless jokes among a certain political party in this House as evidenced in the columns of a popular national newspaper.

Second, a quality of the Fine Gael Party that I have always admired is that of self-reliance, that one should provide for oneself where possible and should not rely on Government to do so. It is perhaps this which prevented Deputy Richard Bruton attending the debate on the medical card issue on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. I am a little perplexed about this. As far as I am aware, having checked the matter on Google, Deputy Bruton did not speak on the issue on either Tuesday or Wednesday night but he did turn up for a vote on the matter at 8.50 p.m. as shown in the vote results on the Internet. I believe the reason for this is because he is imbued with the Fine Gael characteristic of self-reliance that one should [49]not seek or act in a fashion that results in one scattering money all over the place but should, if possible, mind oneself.

It is interesting that nobody has, as yet, picked up on the fact that Deputy Bruton, the shining light of the Fine Gael Party, did not attend that debate.

Deputy Ulick Burke and I soldiered together in our exile in Seanad Éireann and always got on well. Deputy Sheehan stated the reason he was not re-elected to the House. I, too, know why I was not re-elected. However, I am here now and happy to be here, as I am sure is Deputy Ulick Burke.

I was struck by the absence from the debate of these two salient characteristics, namely, Labour Party socialism where one targets money at those who need it and the Fine Gael characteristic of self-reliance. Both were absent from the debate as was Deputy Bruton. Last night, I watched “Tonight with Vincent Browne” on which Deputy Simon Coveney, the breakfast roll man, was a guest. It was interesting to listen to Deputy Coveney try to wriggle his way past questions relating to Deputy Reilly, who was not a guest on the programme. Deputy Reilly is not to be produced publicly for a while.

Deputy Reilly is the man who less than 12 months ago said that medical cards should not be indiscriminately awarded to everybody over the age of 70 years. How quickly he changed his mind. Of course, he was not at that time representing the IMO but was a Member of this House, which makes it even more amazing that he was able to say that.

Some 70 year olds with whom I spoke expressed to me their real fear that by some mischance Fine Gael and Labour and, whoever else they could bring with them — we know they have a few confréres, might form a Government. They genuinely do not want to see those parties in government.

I met several people. They are fearful the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party, parties so strangely in alliance now as they were on previous occasions, would perchance get into government, which would not benefit the country.

This was never going to be a pretty budget, nobody ever said it would be. How could it be? It is a budget in which very practical and austere decisions had to be taken. While we were not aware of the decisions taken, we knew this would be an extremely difficult budget. I believe if the current situation continues, future budgets will be even more difficult.

How can anyone on the one hand say we should give everything to everyone thus making everyone happy and on the other hand say we should not upset anyone or any group?

I will speak briefly on the pupil-teacher ratio. An earlier speaker, Deputy Sheehan, stated that 200 primary teachers and 200 secondary teachers would lose their jobs. No permanent teacher in this country will lose his or her job. Teachers may go to another school either within the panel system or at second level on the redeployment system but a permanent teacher——

A permanent teacher is not allowed to lose his or her job. The idea that teachers will suddenly lose their permanent teaching post is incorrect. I regret any diminution in the standard of teaching care in our schools. The teachers we have at both primary and post-primary level are of the highest calibre.

I lived to tell the tale in this regard. The Acting Chairman and Deputy Burke may not have been here — the Deputy may have been in Garbally — but I was a Deputy in 1987, serving as Minister for Education. I do not know if anybody else in the House now was a Deputy at the time. There was a pupil-teacher ratio change of three proposed at primary level and two at post-primary level. On one Saturday there were marches and I found it difficult to go anywhere, although I went to them. On a Saturday there were 6,000 teachers outside my modest home — if I can describe it as such — in Athlone. I live in a small bungalow on the side of the road and there were gardaí and everything brought to control the 6,000 people outside my house.

The teachers came, sent in a deputation and we spoke before they left and went into town. On the following Monday the Athlone Chamber of Commerce wrote to me to say the town greatly benefited from the numbers at my gate and asked if I could arrange for them to come again.

The hotels, restaurants and shops greatly benefited. I still have the letter because I thought it was such a sign of entrepreneurship that the businesses were willing to seize the day of delight which came to the town. It was not a day of delight for me. I lived through all that and came out the other end. I did not lose my seat in the following election, despite all the furore.

It was a very difficult time but no permanent teacher at primary or post-primary level lost his or her job. There were teachers working on a temporary basis but any profession has temporary positions from time to time. The people who fill them know their mandate to work in the position is limited by the nature of the contract they entered. There are many positives in this budget.

The 12.5% corporation tax is a positive, and the Government stated very clearly this would remain. It will not go up and I hope it may decrease if we overcome this recessionary period. There are many other matters in which the productive elements of this country were helped and will continue to be helped so we will be able to avail of employment opportunities if and when they come. We will be able to work through our difficulties and emerge the other end.

It is a very difficult time and it would be very easy to throw one’s hands up and say we cannot do anything, it is all too difficult and we should all throw money at everything and everybody. We all know what the country would end up like then.

[51]There is no point in saying we brought all this on ourselves, which I have heard. What about the major advances in pension entitlements and special needs assistants, SNAs? Special needs assistants were not heard of ten years ago but now there are SNAs in schools and parents with a child with a particular difficulty can have the assistance of an SNA to help him or her through the school years. The measure was a marvellous advantage in the world of education. I did not bring it in because we had no money at all when I was Minister.

There is also the capital programme, which has a significant backlog of projects to be attended to. Every one of us as Deputies could stand up and list off primary and post-primary projects that are badly needed. We hope that funding from the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O’Keeffe, will enable us to finish what is on hand and give the go-ahead to some new projects.

The agricultural community is gearing up for difficult times and public meetings are being called. I hear from Athlone that there were five meetings on one night, with three for teachers and two for farmers. We will need helicopters to get around to all the meetings but we will go.

I always faced up to people wherever there were difficulties. It does not cause me joy to do so but neither does it cause me unrest or disquiet. I am convinced the country is worth backing up now in order that we can come through the difficulties and emerge at the other end.
