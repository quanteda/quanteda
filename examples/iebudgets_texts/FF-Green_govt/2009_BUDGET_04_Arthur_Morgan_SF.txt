<<<<<<< HEAD
I welcome the opportunity to respond to the Minister for Finance. The former US president Mr. Harry Truman kept a plaque on his desk that read, “The buck stops here”. For the last year, as we witnessed the turn in the tide of our economy, the Government has run itself along the lines of, “The buck stops nowhere”. I wish to make it clear to this Government that the buck stops with it. It is in charge and was quick to take credit for the boom. It must, therefore, take responsibility for the bust. Sinn Féin approached the budget prepared to support any measures that would stabilise and reinvigorate the economy, prioritise [460]job creation, address the significant shortfall in public finances, deal with cost-of-living pressures, and provide solutions for those who have become unemployed or who face unemployment.

We argued for the Government to see this budget as an opportunity to turn around the economy. We wanted a budget that was about more than balancing the books, an approach we believe has the potential to drive us further into recession, rather than lift us out of it. We wanted it to provide a vision for a new economic model, based on sound industries such as research and development, exports and a thriving indigenous small and medium enterprise sector, capable of delivering the revenue needed next year to revive the public finances.

Today, people wanted to see the beginning of a three year plan to get the economy back on track. Central to that wish is the creation and retention of jobs and addressing the shortfall in public finances. The Government fell far short on both counts today. It failed the leadership test. It promised to look after the most vulnerable but it did not. It said it would ensure top earners paid their fair share, but it did not. It promised frontline services in health and education would be protected but that did not happen either.

We can rebuild the economy, but that means taking bold decisions. It means investing in infrastructure that will create jobs and build competitiveness. It means helping those who have lost their jobs return to the workforce as quickly as possible and ensure such people are supported properly while that happens. It means ending the era of tax breaks for the rich, while PAYE workers struggle to survive. It means truly advancing the all-Ireland economy. Change is possible and it should have started this afternoon. It did not and the State will be poorer next year because of that.

We have witnessed an extraordinary economic period. Gross domestic product and gross national product increased exponentially in the past decade. Ireland turned from an emigrant country to a destination for economic migrants. We saw an explosion in purchasing power as evidenced by the growth in home ownership, high-end cars and in quality brand names on our shopping streets. Simultaneously, Government policy ensured that massive private debt accumulated. As the gap widened, the void between the rich and poor became more obvious and precarious. The Government spent wildly during this period, mostly on tax breaks for those who least needed them, keeping the consultant industry in business and on wasteful pet projects. It did not use the budget surpluses to turn Ireland into a first world model. It used them to buy elections.

Anyone believing the Opposition spokespeople who preceded me would have implemented different economic policies which would have led the State down an alternative path need only cast their memories back to these parties’ pre-election manifestos in 2007. Both promised tax cuts alongside increased public spending. They criticise Fianna Fáil now, but shared the same economic outlook then. Of course, it was the Government that did the real damage. It presided over many investment failures, especially with regard to value for money. There was no strategic investment in broadband, revitalising rural Ireland, renewable energy, ports, or public transport, despite some small exceptions like the Luas. Of the infrastructural projects undertaken, few came in on time or on budget. We need only consider the example of the Dublin Port tunnel. The original cost was €457 million, but it eventually cost €752 million, representing poor value for money.

The Government’s property-based tax relief left us with many hotels, car parks and shopping centres, instead of social housing, rail lines and wind farms. Now we face a period of virtually no infrastructure development. How is the State supposed to develop its competitiveness when [461]it does not have something as necessary as universal, high speed and quality broadband provision?

As well as failing to invest, the Government took reckless decision after reckless decision relating to the tax system. Measures were introduced to the tax base which resulted in a dangerous over-dependence on construction and consumption-related revenue. Stable sources of tax were cut. Its failure to grapple with the mistakes it made in the tax system was reflected in abysmal fashion throughout this year and last year, and in its inability to project from month to month what was coming into the Exchequer’s funds. As a result, the Government in the budget had to take into consideration a projected tax receipt shortfall of €6.5 billion for 2008 and now an Exchequer deficit of 11.5% projected to be some €14.7 billion next year. To put this in perspective, I recall the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, assuring us in this month last year that gross domestic product growth in 2008 would be approximately 3%, more modest than we were used to but growth nonetheless. Instead, we have seen an unprecedented negative turnaround in growth. Unemployment has reached its highest level in a decade, resulting in lower income tax returns and a growing demand on the social insurance fund. Inflation measured 4.3% in September and this has impacted on consumer spending. Consequently, consumption revenue with VAT returns are €1.1 billion behind target to date.

The Government has pointed to international forces for the downturn and tried to deny that the policies it pursued lacked foresight, encouraged instability and indulged speculative greed. The global downturn has impacted on international trade and the banks’ liquidity issue poses its own problems. However, the Government could have left the State in a much better position to cope with the crisis. Instead of building the State’s competitiveness, Fianna Fáil and its construction partners left us economically dependent on the construction industry, with stamp duty rising from 3% of the Government’s total tax take in 1997 to 8% in 2006, accompanied by huge VAT returns from house build costs. The growth of this sector allowed the Government, the heads of the industry and, of course, the good old banks to profit from those who got into debt when trying to own a home. In the interim, the Government abandoned real economic development. Our exports market was ignored. The banks took the Government’s lead.

At a recent ISME conference, business people pointed out that over the past ten years, the banks did not want to know them unless they had property. They were told they could not borrow to support start-up companies unless properties were included in their business plans. The owners of small and medium-sized enterprises are being denied overdraft facilities by banks which are burdened with properties while simultaneously nursing developers’ loans. The Government’s unconditional support of property developers has harmed this State’s competitiveness. Property tax reliefs ate into money that could and should have funded necessary infrastructure. High property prices had a further detrimental effect on business as rents spiralled. However, the Government continued to claim, right up to its lengthy summer break, that the fundamentals of the economy were sound. It is still repeating this.

Some deeply misleading claims have been made over recent times. A recent report, Catching the Wave, made such claims in respect of our export market. In 2006, foreign-owned firms which are based in Ireland were responsible for 90.2% of all exports from this country. The indigenous export sector is crying out for Government intervention. The domestic market is equally badly-off. The Government has failed to tackle the flooding of the Irish market with cheap imports. It has not dealt with contentious issues such as sell-by dates and the incorrect labelling of products as “guaranteed Irish”. These two issues were mentioned by the owners of Cappoquin Chickens before the company went into liquidation and had to be sold to foreign owners, who are only willing to pay the staff the minimum wage to keep the operation going.

[462]Sinn Féin was attacked by all parties in this House when it said the Government’s economic policy was not sustainable and would come crashing down. Now that the crash has happened, we firmly believe the most important role the Government can play in the current crisis is to ensure there is employment for the many people who are being made redundant. I refer to those who were working in the construction sector, for example. Equally, the Government should ensure that people are not made homeless as a result of negative equity and repossessions.

In the run-up to this budget, the debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas, the media and the street has centred around how little money the Government will have to run the State next year. Many people asked how much it would need to borrow and where cuts would need to be made. Throughout this debate, Sinn Féin argued that there should be a focus on how to create jobs over the next year. We need to turn the economy around and build a revenue stream that will make cuts in future budgets unnecessary. Vested interest lobby groups have suggested that overspending by the Government has caused problems for the Exchequer. They have called for cuts to be made. However, our level of public spending is the third lowest in Europe. Lithuania and Estonia are the only countries that spend less than we do. We are coming from a low base. Far more spending was required over the last decade to construct the physical and social infrastructure needed to develop the State’s competitiveness and eradicate poverty. Unfortunately, what was spent was spent badly, in the main.

Other groups have launched attacks on public sector personnel. I do not doubt that efficiency savings can be made in the public service. In this time of financial turmoil, value for money is essential. However, the last thing the State needs is a reduction in the number of nurses, gardaí or teachers. We need reviews of bodies like the HSE. We need leadership from the Members of this House. How many elected representatives are maintaining their jobs in the public sector, thereby holding onto pensions and other entitlements which accompany such jobs? We need to bring an end to the giving of disproportionate bonuses regardless of performance. I refer to the bonuses which were reported in the media last weekend, for example. We do not need cuts that will harm frontline services and prolong the recession.

Sinn Féin has highlighted the spending that is needed to help the most vulnerable people in society. Their lot has not improved over the past decade. Many people will tune in to the “Six One News” tonight to learn if anything has been done to help them pay their exorbitant mortgages, to keep them in employment, to provide books, uniforms and school meals for their children, to provide child care places so they do not have to fork out thousands of euro each month for private facilities, to alleviate their health costs and to reduce the impact of inflation on their diminishing wages. I am conscious of the plight of people in more desperate situations. I refer to those who have become unemployed, who are struggling to get by on inadequate welfare payments, who are at risk of fuel and food poverty this winter, who fear for their children’s health and their own health, who face eviction from unscrupulous landlords or whose homes may be repossessed by the banks.

In its pre-budget submission, Sinn Féin called for supports to be given to the most vulnerable people in society. We believe the Government has a responsibility to protect the weakest first. It should take care of children, the elderly, the sick, the poor and people with disabilities before it worries about anyone else. The Government could have shown more foresight. It could have put in place a three-year plan to get the economy back on track. Instead, it is engaging in a book-keeping exercise. A former US President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, turned the tide of his country’s economic fortunes when he established what was known as the time as the “New Deal”. Under that programme, widespread government borrowing took place to fund major [463]public works, employ millions of people and slowly bring the economy back to life. The “New Deal” showed initiative and courage.

Sinn Féin argued in the run-up to the budget that immediate economic stabilisation measures should be taken. We said that the Government should prioritise job creation, for example, by initiating an immediate retraining programme for construction workers to direct them into the renewable energy sector and other industries. We proposed that the commitments under the national development plan in the areas of social and affordable housing and school building be frontloaded to provide necessary infrastructure and secure jobs and tax revenue. Under this budget, however, investment in social housing is to decrease by 2% and investment in affordable housing is to decrease by a whopping 30%, which is totally unacceptable.

At the end of 2007, the National Pensions Reserve Fund contained €21.2 billion. In March of this year, it was estimated that the size of the fund had dropped to €19.4 billion. It is clear that money is being lost on the stock markets, although much of the losses are only on paper until the moneys are withdrawn and any gains realised. It would be more responsible for the Government to use a proportion of the National Pensions Reserve Fund for infrastructural investment.

Sinn Féin has called on the Government to reduce the cost of living pressures on the low-paid and those who depend on social welfare by establishing an anti-inflation package and delivering social welfare increases. It has asked the Government to bring forward a set of proposals to reduce cost pressures on small businesses and to put in place specific programmes to support indigenous businesses which are seeking to boost their export capacity. It has proposed that the tax system be overhauled to assist those on low incomes. Those at the higher end of the scale should pay their fair share of taxes if we are to generate sufficient revenue to meet medium-term investment and current spending demands.

In the wake of the decision earlier this month to guarantee the banking system, we called for the Government to use the guarantee as a further way of contributing to the Exchequer and stabilising the economy. We want the banks to make a windfall payment to the State, as a proper payback for the taxpayers’ insurance. A levy should be introduced on the banks’ profits as part of the new regulatory regime. We want the State to have shares in the banks and take positions on their boards so it can monitor the interests of the taxpayer. Measures should be introduced as part of the guarantee to protect those who are facing home repossessions. The banks have a duty to take the steps needed to reschedule the mortgage payments of low-income families. The Money Advice and Budgeting Service should be put on a statutory footing to ensure it has the authority to negotiate with the banks.

This budget, as well as stabilising the economy next year, should have aimed to stimulate it in the medium to longer term. Sinn Féin wants investment under the national development plan to prioritise public transport, communication, health, education, renewable energy and child care.

We want investment in education and training programmes to be linked to information technologies. We also want the national action plan for social inclusion to be delivered. Our approach to this budget has been unique. Rather than focusing on cuts, we focused on revenue generating ideas and job creation. It is a poor indication of what we will face in next year’s budget that this Government did not take the same approach, but chose instead to make savings in areas where we can least afford them.

For too long, our taxation system has been biased in favour of the well off. I have already mentioned how this Government’s policies led to instability in the tax system, but nobody [464]should think that such instability was an accident of design. We have the fifth lowest tax take in the European Union. The tax structure by tax type — indirect 44%, direct 40% and social security contributions 15% — differs considerably from the structure typical for the EU as a whole, where on average there is less reliance on indirect tax. The fact is, if there is high VAT, there is a range of stealth taxes on everything from accident and emergency visits to waste management, and this will have a disproportionate effect on those with the least in their pockets.

Sinn Féin has long called for reform of the tax system. There are people in the system paying too little and people paying too much. The biggest con-trick the Government ever played on the people was convincing them that we have a low-tax economy. We only have a low-tax economy for those who are well off. Everyone else is paying through the nose. In our pre-budget submission, we called for the Government to undertake a rolling review of taxation, through the Commission on Taxation, with a view to increasing the number of income tax bands. This morning the Minister for Finance stated that the Government’s priority was to protect the vulnerable and to ensure that those who earn the most pay the most in tax. He said he supported a progressive tax system. This would be a major Government U-turn in policy if it was delivered, but it has not been delivered. Instead, the budget only tinkered at the edges of the taxation system and with stealth taxes, as opposed to overhauling the system to bring in money to the Exchequer. The Minister has made the situation far worse for many families, particularly those most vulnerable. The income levy and the VAT increase are a disgraceful attack on people on low incomes. They are neither fair nor progressive.

I welcome the Minister’s decision to take on board our proposals to increase the PAYE tax credit to meet the annual increase in the cost of living, the increase in betting tax and DIRT. However, we have serious concerns regarding other measures. The proposed income levy is regressive. While it is positive that people earning more than €100,000 will pay 2%, the fact that all those on under this figure will pay the same levy means it disproportionately hits those on low incomes. It is almost a flat tax. The increase of the 21% VAT rate by 0.5% is also regressive. It will hit low income families and does nothing to reverse the State’s dependence on consumption taxes, one of the key contributors to the current public finance difficulties.

Prior to the budget, we had called for all discretionary tax relief schemes to be available at the standard rate. This would have yielded €1 billion to the Exchequer. It is staggering that the Minister only tinkered with this. It is also hard to understand why the Government failed to abolish the ceiling on PRSI. The social insurance fund will come under more pressure until we can get people back into work, and this measure would have provided essential resources.

I am also concerned that there were no firm proposals on utilising the National Pensions Reserve Fund. We called for this money to be used to fund critical infrastructure projects that would improve competitiveness and provide jobs. There is now concern that this fund will be used to help recapitalise the banks. That should not happen. The Minister said that no vested interests were served in this budget, yet the Construction Industry Federation’s demands on cutting commercial stamp duty have been almost wholly met by slashing this tax from 9% to 6%.

We proposed a number of additional revenue producing initiatives, such as increasing motor tax for the highest emitting non-commercial vehicles, increasing the health levy by 1% on those earning more than €100,000 per annum, introducing legislation to end tax-exile status and ending State subsidies to private schools. Denis O’Brien and Bono, two of our biggest tax exiles, will not be perturbed by this budget. Bono’s concern for Africa is laudable, but it is a pity he does not share the same concern for the people in this State.

[465]The fear among the most vulnerable in society that this budget would harm them most has been realised.

I do not blame those tax exiles for availing of the opportunity. I blame the Government for providing it to them. I just felt it was essential to use an example of these multimillionaires swanning around the globe while the Government allows them to pay no tax in this State.

We have all heard the reports that social welfare payments would be frozen, that child benefit would be taxed, that the Department of Social and Family Affairs had the biggest expenditure and is a so-called drain on the public purse strings. This system is meant to aid those in need, whether they have lost their jobs, are part of a family on low income, are elderly, disabled or ill. Social welfare is not charity for the State to dole out at will. It is a right and an entitlement, and the money within the system is put there ever year by taxpayers, conscious of the fact that they might one day need to access it. If the budget of the Department of Social and Family Affairs is rising, the Government should look at why so many are accessing the system, and set about finding solutions to get people off social welfare and back into employment. The Government’s responsibility is not about making savings that will harm the most vulnerable.

This budget did not take that sensible approach. Instead, it chose to make savings by cutting payments like the early child care supplement. This supplement was introduced as a poor attempt at dealing with the lack of a functioning State child care policy. There was no attempt to make this cut equitable. In a recent parliamentary question, I asked how much money would be saved were this payment to be made only to families earning less than €100,000 per annum. The response, based on revenue estimates, was that this process of payment would save the state €71 million. Did the Government undertake any kind of study regarding this proposal before it made this decision, or did it just arbitrarily decide to slash a percentage of the payment to everyone?

The individual payment increases will do nothing to make next year any easier for those struggling with poverty. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul reported a 50% increase in requests for assistance in the first half of 2008. Threshold has highlighted the significant increase in illegal evictions caused by landlords running into mortgage arrears, and a dramatic increase in home repossession. Merchant’s Quay Ireland reported an 11% increase in the number of meals it provided to homeless people this year. Failure to protect our most vulnerable in this budget will do nothing to fix our economy next year. It will merely create more poverty traps, more misery and more social problems in the years to come.

When cuts were mentioned in advance of this budget, the Government stated clearly that they would not affect front line services in health and education. This budget is an attack on our health services. The paltry increase in funding falls far short of clearly identified needs and will undoubtedly lead to deterioration in services. Health cuts were introduced before last year’s budget and have accelerated since. Patients were being turned away this morning from Our Lady of Lourdes hospital in Drogheda because of overcrowding. Deputy Ó Caoláin has learned that a promised and much needed ambulance will not now be provided to Monaghan General Hospital. The orthopaedic unit at Our Lady’s Hospital in Navan looks set to close for [466]four months. The Minister for Health and Children and Professor Brendan Drumm promised that cuts would not affect patient care, but we have not seen any proof. This budget will speed up the process. Patients will suffer and patients will die as a result of this budget.

Far from representing savings, these cuts are shortsighted and will cost more in the long run. The cuts in home help hours and other services in the community for older people will force more of them from their own homes, and into expensive nursing home care, much of which will be subsidised by the State at a huge cost.

The closure of hospital services across the State for weeks on end to stay within HSE budgets is another false economy as hospital staff continue to be paid and facilities maintained while these facilities are closed to patients. I refer to an example from my area. Last Christmas, Navan orthopaedic unit was closed for several months, but the nurses, consultants and other staff were still paid and the only saving was in the replacement body parts, hips and knees, which were to be used. The people who needed those replacements in December when the closure occurred still needed them in January, February, March and April, the only difference being that they were suffering more and the queues were growing longer. This is very poor efficiency and shame on the Government for allowing that to happen and for continuing with that disgraceful policy.

With rising unemployment leading to an increase in the numbers of people eligible for the medical card, it is essential that services for medical card patients are maintained. GPs must be discouraged from setting quotas for medical card holders. It is wrong that entitled families are refused by doctor after doctor. The Government has failed to fulfil its own commitments to index the income thresholds for medical cards to increases in the average industrial wage and double the income limit eligibility of parents of children under six years of age and treble them for parents of children under 18 years of age with an intellectual disability. When the over 70s non-means tested medical card was introduced, Sinn Féin asked why the same principle was not applied to people under 18, people with a range of medical conditions and, indeed, all citizens. This scheme has been withdrawn and that demonstrates the lack of consistency and the inequity at the heart of Government health policy. That will hurt many elderly people who do not meet whatever means criteria are set out for the medial card. It is most unfortunate the Green Party could not exercise more influence to ensure the scheme was continued.

Given the current shortfall in public finances, it is crucial that the Government ends the massive waste of resources and inequality caused by the two tier public-private health system.

The cost to the Exchequer of tax foregone in capital allowances to the developers of private hospitals rose from €1.9 million in 2004 to €10.6 million in 2006, with figures for 2007 and 2008 not yet available. The cost in 2006 alone would fund over 6,000 extra full medical cards for a year. The private hospital co-location scheme is another massive subsidy to the private health business. The cost of tax breaks for these developments is not yet known and it cannot be quantified. The land to which they have been given access is a huge asset which will be lost to the public health system. Ultimately, the only guarantee of equal access and real efficiency in our health services will be fundamental reform and the establishment of a universal public health system, with access based on need alone, free at the point of delivery and funded from general, fair and progressive taxation.

Sinn Féin wants to see the immediate establishment of a health funding commission to report within a year on the costs of the transition to a new single tier public health system with universal provision, taking into account all spending on health services under the current systems, including State funding and spending on private health insurance.

[467]Education is another area which the Government promised to protect from cuts in this budget. Given that the system is barely existing on its current funds, a marginal increase is akin to cuts in real terms. We accept that this is a new economic environment, but the education sector must be considered as part of an overall strategy to reverse the current economic outlook and to ensure the long-term stability of the Irish economy. We cannot build a knowledge economy if we do not invest in knowledge from pre-school up through the system.

Perhaps the most blatant neglect and disregard shown to our young people by the Government is in the area of school buildings. The Minister has effectively deceived the Dáil on this issue. Investment in primary school building was not increased but rather it was reduced by 5%. Public-private partnership costs have gone up by 30%. The recently introduced school building programme is completely inadequate. Only 25 schools are to benefit, which means hundreds of schools will be disappointed. One third of our primary schools have applied for a new school or need building works on their existing school. Glenswilly national school in Donegal has been innovative in its response. It has renamed itself, Seeking an Extension since 1992. Unfortunately, the Government showed no such innovation. I called to St. Joseph’s school in Mell in Drogheda this morning where 211 pupils are crammed into all sorts of closeted conditions. Two cloakrooms have been converted into classrooms. Other pupils wishing to use the toilet are forced to go through those tiny cloakrooms.

I hope that some parties within the Government will seek to change Government policy in this regard. Those children are not receiving an adequate education. Six of the classes in St. Joseph’s school in Mell have more than 30 students.

This programme came on the back of the revelation that many schools that have been given approval for extensions cannot proceed to construction because the funds provided only cover a fraction of the actual cost. The Department of Education and Science spends €35.5 million per annum on prefabricated buildings. That is a complete waste of money. It is money down the drain. I spoke earlier about how the downturn in the domestic building sector provides an opportunity to address historic underfunding of school buildings in a way that will provide real value for money. Now is the time for immediate recommencement of the school building programme to ensure that all schools with unsafe and substandard accommodation are upgraded immediately.

I also draw attention to the inadequate primary capitation grant system. Energy costs, waste disposal charges, water charges, with cleaning and hygiene costs, have increased dramatically and schools can no longer meet those costs. On average, after receiving all funding available from the State, each primary school has an average annual debt of €23,000. That means that €82 million has to be raised by parents, friends and school boards this year to cover the debts of primary schools throughout the State. This places pressure on parents, many of whom are struggling to make ends meet in the current climate. That is a pressure that should not exist in a State with so-called free education. A total of €82 million in this year alone is some free education system.

The Minister’s party with Fianna Fáil and with what is left of the Progressive Democrats has presided over an absolutely disgraceful budget. The Minister of State should have used his influence to make this budget more progressive and effective for the people, but he failed to do so. I am happy to allow him to heckle me because I will call it as it is and I will hold him and the Government to account regardless of whether he likes it.

[468]This budget provides no funding to solve the problem of classroom overcrowding. The programme for Government commits the Government to:

Increase the number of primary teachers by at least 4,000. This will enable us to reduce class sizes.

The Minister of State should tell the children of Mell that. The aim is to reduce class sizes to 24 by 2010-11. There is little chance of this happening, given the attitude of the Government this afternoon. Yet, almost 100,000 children remain in classes of 30 pupils or more. The lack of funding in this sector has also had detrimental effects on the identification of children with special needs and has failed to solve the issue of illiteracy. An estimated 500,000 Irish adults have literacy difficulties. This is an educational crisis. To have any hope of developing the economy, we need to eradicate illiteracy, introduce paid educational leave as a statutory entitlement and make work-based learning and training available to all workers. In yet another budget, the Government has failed to identify the potential for education development and the return it will bring, not just for the next generation but for ourselves.

Given the public finance shortfall, we knew this budget would be tough. I have talked about what has got us into this mess and I have had a go at the Government for decisions it has taken and those they have failed to take. However, when all is said and done, the Sinn Féin Deputies were prepared to come into this Chamber and support measures which we believed offered responsible solutions to the current mess created by the Government.

I appreciate the pressure the Minister for Finance labours under in delivering this budget, but this budget will not turn around the economy. It contains short-sighted and, in many cases, irresponsible measures.

This budget needed to look to the future. It had to deliver a new value for money ethos. It needed to contain a vision for the creation of jobs. It had to deliver funding to those Departments that will help the economy in the long term, namely, the Department of Education and Science and those dealing with the fallout from years of underfunding, such as the Department of Health and Children. Instead, it tinkers at the edges of the crisis, makes cuts where they will hurt the most and displays no real political leadership to get this State back on its feet. We needed a brave budget but instead we have been presented with a blinkered one.

I look forward to continuing the debate on this matter. I also look forward to continuing to hold the Government to account because, by God, that needs to happen.
=======
I welcome the opportunity to respond to the Minister for Finance. The former US president Mr. Harry Truman kept a plaque on his desk that read, “The buck stops here”. For the last year, as we witnessed the turn in the tide of our economy, the Government has run itself along the lines of, “The buck stops nowhere”. I wish to make it clear to this Government that the buck stops with it. It is in charge and was quick to take credit for the boom. It must, therefore, take responsibility for the bust. Sinn Féin approached the budget prepared to support any measures that would stabilise and reinvigorate the economy, prioritise [460]job creation, address the significant shortfall in public finances, deal with cost-of-living pressures, and provide solutions for those who have become unemployed or who face unemployment.

We argued for the Government to see this budget as an opportunity to turn around the economy. We wanted a budget that was about more than balancing the books, an approach we believe has the potential to drive us further into recession, rather than lift us out of it. We wanted it to provide a vision for a new economic model, based on sound industries such as research and development, exports and a thriving indigenous small and medium enterprise sector, capable of delivering the revenue needed next year to revive the public finances.

Today, people wanted to see the beginning of a three year plan to get the economy back on track. Central to that wish is the creation and retention of jobs and addressing the shortfall in public finances. The Government fell far short on both counts today. It failed the leadership test. It promised to look after the most vulnerable but it did not. It said it would ensure top earners paid their fair share, but it did not. It promised frontline services in health and education would be protected but that did not happen either.

We can rebuild the economy, but that means taking bold decisions. It means investing in infrastructure that will create jobs and build competitiveness. It means helping those who have lost their jobs return to the workforce as quickly as possible and ensure such people are supported properly while that happens. It means ending the era of tax breaks for the rich, while PAYE workers struggle to survive. It means truly advancing the all-Ireland economy. Change is possible and it should have started this afternoon. It did not and the State will be poorer next year because of that.

We have witnessed an extraordinary economic period. Gross domestic product and gross national product increased exponentially in the past decade. Ireland turned from an emigrant country to a destination for economic migrants. We saw an explosion in purchasing power as evidenced by the growth in home ownership, high-end cars and in quality brand names on our shopping streets. Simultaneously, Government policy ensured that massive private debt accumulated. As the gap widened, the void between the rich and poor became more obvious and precarious. The Government spent wildly during this period, mostly on tax breaks for those who least needed them, keeping the consultant industry in business and on wasteful pet projects. It did not use the budget surpluses to turn Ireland into a first world model. It used them to buy elections.

Anyone believing the Opposition spokespeople who preceded me would have implemented different economic policies which would have led the State down an alternative path need only cast their memories back to these parties’ pre-election manifestos in 2007. Both promised tax cuts alongside increased public spending. They criticise Fianna Fáil now, but shared the same economic outlook then. Of course, it was the Government that did the real damage. It presided over many investment failures, especially with regard to value for money. There was no strategic investment in broadband, revitalising rural Ireland, renewable energy, ports, or public transport, despite some small exceptions like the Luas. Of the infrastructural projects undertaken, few came in on time or on budget. We need only consider the example of the Dublin Port tunnel. The original cost was €457 million, but it eventually cost €752 million, representing poor value for money.

The Government’s property-based tax relief left us with many hotels, car parks and shopping centres, instead of social housing, rail lines and wind farms. Now we face a period of virtually no infrastructure development. How is the State supposed to develop its competitiveness when [461]it does not have something as necessary as universal, high speed and quality broadband provision?

As well as failing to invest, the Government took reckless decision after reckless decision relating to the tax system. Measures were introduced to the tax base which resulted in a dangerous over-dependence on construction and consumption-related revenue. Stable sources of tax were cut. Its failure to grapple with the mistakes it made in the tax system was reflected in abysmal fashion throughout this year and last year, and in its inability to project from month to month what was coming into the Exchequer’s funds. As a result, the Government in the budget had to take into consideration a projected tax receipt shortfall of €6.5 billion for 2008 and now an Exchequer deficit of 11.5% projected to be some €14.7 billion next year. To put this in perspective, I recall the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, assuring us in this month last year that gross domestic product growth in 2008 would be approximately 3%, more modest than we were used to but growth nonetheless. Instead, we have seen an unprecedented negative turnaround in growth. Unemployment has reached its highest level in a decade, resulting in lower income tax returns and a growing demand on the social insurance fund. Inflation measured 4.3% in September and this has impacted on consumer spending. Consequently, consumption revenue with VAT returns are €1.1 billion behind target to date.

The Government has pointed to international forces for the downturn and tried to deny that the policies it pursued lacked foresight, encouraged instability and indulged speculative greed. The global downturn has impacted on international trade and the banks’ liquidity issue poses its own problems. However, the Government could have left the State in a much better position to cope with the crisis. Instead of building the State’s competitiveness, Fianna Fáil and its construction partners left us economically dependent on the construction industry, with stamp duty rising from 3% of the Government’s total tax take in 1997 to 8% in 2006, accompanied by huge VAT returns from house build costs. The growth of this sector allowed the Government, the heads of the industry and, of course, the good old banks to profit from those who got into debt when trying to own a home. In the interim, the Government abandoned real economic development. Our exports market was ignored. The banks took the Government’s lead.

At a recent ISME conference, business people pointed out that over the past ten years, the banks did not want to know them unless they had property. They were told they could not borrow to support start-up companies unless properties were included in their business plans. The owners of small and medium-sized enterprises are being denied overdraft facilities by banks which are burdened with properties while simultaneously nursing developers’ loans. The Government’s unconditional support of property developers has harmed this State’s competitiveness. Property tax reliefs ate into money that could and should have funded necessary infrastructure. High property prices had a further detrimental effect on business as rents spiralled. However, the Government continued to claim, right up to its lengthy summer break, that the fundamentals of the economy were sound. It is still repeating this.

Some deeply misleading claims have been made over recent times. A recent report, Catching the Wave, made such claims in respect of our export market. In 2006, foreign-owned firms which are based in Ireland were responsible for 90.2% of all exports from this country. The indigenous export sector is crying out for Government intervention. The domestic market is equally badly-off. The Government has failed to tackle the flooding of the Irish market with cheap imports. It has not dealt with contentious issues such as sell-by dates and the incorrect labelling of products as “guaranteed Irish”. These two issues were mentioned by the owners of Cappoquin Chickens before the company went into liquidation and had to be sold to foreign owners, who are only willing to pay the staff the minimum wage to keep the operation going.

[462]Sinn Féin was attacked by all parties in this House when it said the Government’s economic policy was not sustainable and would come crashing down. Now that the crash has happened, we firmly believe the most important role the Government can play in the current crisis is to ensure there is employment for the many people who are being made redundant. I refer to those who were working in the construction sector, for example. Equally, the Government should ensure that people are not made homeless as a result of negative equity and repossessions.

In the run-up to this budget, the debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas, the media and the street has centred around how little money the Government will have to run the State next year. Many people asked how much it would need to borrow and where cuts would need to be made. Throughout this debate, Sinn Féin argued that there should be a focus on how to create jobs over the next year. We need to turn the economy around and build a revenue stream that will make cuts in future budgets unnecessary. Vested interest lobby groups have suggested that overspending by the Government has caused problems for the Exchequer. They have called for cuts to be made. However, our level of public spending is the third lowest in Europe. Lithuania and Estonia are the only countries that spend less than we do. We are coming from a low base. Far more spending was required over the last decade to construct the physical and social infrastructure needed to develop the State’s competitiveness and eradicate poverty. Unfortunately, what was spent was spent badly, in the main.

Other groups have launched attacks on public sector personnel. I do not doubt that efficiency savings can be made in the public service. In this time of financial turmoil, value for money is essential. However, the last thing the State needs is a reduction in the number of nurses, gardaí or teachers. We need reviews of bodies like the HSE. We need leadership from the Members of this House. How many elected representatives are maintaining their jobs in the public sector, thereby holding onto pensions and other entitlements which accompany such jobs? We need to bring an end to the giving of disproportionate bonuses regardless of performance. I refer to the bonuses which were reported in the media last weekend, for example. We do not need cuts that will harm frontline services and prolong the recession.

Sinn Féin has highlighted the spending that is needed to help the most vulnerable people in society. Their lot has not improved over the past decade. Many people will tune in to the “Six One News” tonight to learn if anything has been done to help them pay their exorbitant mortgages, to keep them in employment, to provide books, uniforms and school meals for their children, to provide child care places so they do not have to fork out thousands of euro each month for private facilities, to alleviate their health costs and to reduce the impact of inflation on their diminishing wages. I am conscious of the plight of people in more desperate situations. I refer to those who have become unemployed, who are struggling to get by on inadequate welfare payments, who are at risk of fuel and food poverty this winter, who fear for their children’s health and their own health, who face eviction from unscrupulous landlords or whose homes may be repossessed by the banks.

In its pre-budget submission, Sinn Féin called for supports to be given to the most vulnerable people in society. We believe the Government has a responsibility to protect the weakest first. It should take care of children, the elderly, the sick, the poor and people with disabilities before it worries about anyone else. The Government could have shown more foresight. It could have put in place a three-year plan to get the economy back on track. Instead, it is engaging in a book-keeping exercise. A former US President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, turned the tide of his country’s economic fortunes when he established what was known as the time as the “New Deal”. Under that programme, widespread government borrowing took place to fund major [463]public works, employ millions of people and slowly bring the economy back to life. The “New Deal” showed initiative and courage.

Sinn Féin argued in the run-up to the budget that immediate economic stabilisation measures should be taken. We said that the Government should prioritise job creation, for example, by initiating an immediate retraining programme for construction workers to direct them into the renewable energy sector and other industries. We proposed that the commitments under the national development plan in the areas of social and affordable housing and school building be frontloaded to provide necessary infrastructure and secure jobs and tax revenue. Under this budget, however, investment in social housing is to decrease by 2% and investment in affordable housing is to decrease by a whopping 30%, which is totally unacceptable.

At the end of 2007, the National Pensions Reserve Fund contained €21.2 billion. In March of this year, it was estimated that the size of the fund had dropped to €19.4 billion. It is clear that money is being lost on the stock markets, although much of the losses are only on paper until the moneys are withdrawn and any gains realised. It would be more responsible for the Government to use a proportion of the National Pensions Reserve Fund for infrastructural investment.

Sinn Féin has called on the Government to reduce the cost of living pressures on the low-paid and those who depend on social welfare by establishing an anti-inflation package and delivering social welfare increases. It has asked the Government to bring forward a set of proposals to reduce cost pressures on small businesses and to put in place specific programmes to support indigenous businesses which are seeking to boost their export capacity. It has proposed that the tax system be overhauled to assist those on low incomes. Those at the higher end of the scale should pay their fair share of taxes if we are to generate sufficient revenue to meet medium-term investment and current spending demands.

In the wake of the decision earlier this month to guarantee the banking system, we called for the Government to use the guarantee as a further way of contributing to the Exchequer and stabilising the economy. We want the banks to make a windfall payment to the State, as a proper payback for the taxpayers’ insurance. A levy should be introduced on the banks’ profits as part of the new regulatory regime. We want the State to have shares in the banks and take positions on their boards so it can monitor the interests of the taxpayer. Measures should be introduced as part of the guarantee to protect those who are facing home repossessions. The banks have a duty to take the steps needed to reschedule the mortgage payments of low-income families. The Money Advice and Budgeting Service should be put on a statutory footing to ensure it has the authority to negotiate with the banks.

This budget, as well as stabilising the economy next year, should have aimed to stimulate it in the medium to longer term. Sinn Féin wants investment under the national development plan to prioritise public transport, communication, health, education, renewable energy and child care.

We want investment in education and training programmes to be linked to information technologies. We also want the national action plan for social inclusion to be delivered. Our approach to this budget has been unique. Rather than focusing on cuts, we focused on revenue generating ideas and job creation. It is a poor indication of what we will face in next year’s budget that this Government did not take the same approach, but chose instead to make savings in areas where we can least afford them.

For too long, our taxation system has been biased in favour of the well off. I have already mentioned how this Government’s policies led to instability in the tax system, but nobody [464]should think that such instability was an accident of design. We have the fifth lowest tax take in the European Union. The tax structure by tax type — indirect 44%, direct 40% and social security contributions 15% — differs considerably from the structure typical for the EU as a whole, where on average there is less reliance on indirect tax. The fact is, if there is high VAT, there is a range of stealth taxes on everything from accident and emergency visits to waste management, and this will have a disproportionate effect on those with the least in their pockets.

Sinn Féin has long called for reform of the tax system. There are people in the system paying too little and people paying too much. The biggest con-trick the Government ever played on the people was convincing them that we have a low-tax economy. We only have a low-tax economy for those who are well off. Everyone else is paying through the nose. In our pre-budget submission, we called for the Government to undertake a rolling review of taxation, through the Commission on Taxation, with a view to increasing the number of income tax bands. This morning the Minister for Finance stated that the Government’s priority was to protect the vulnerable and to ensure that those who earn the most pay the most in tax. He said he supported a progressive tax system. This would be a major Government U-turn in policy if it was delivered, but it has not been delivered. Instead, the budget only tinkered at the edges of the taxation system and with stealth taxes, as opposed to overhauling the system to bring in money to the Exchequer. The Minister has made the situation far worse for many families, particularly those most vulnerable. The income levy and the VAT increase are a disgraceful attack on people on low incomes. They are neither fair nor progressive.

I welcome the Minister’s decision to take on board our proposals to increase the PAYE tax credit to meet the annual increase in the cost of living, the increase in betting tax and DIRT. However, we have serious concerns regarding other measures. The proposed income levy is regressive. While it is positive that people earning more than €100,000 will pay 2%, the fact that all those on under this figure will pay the same levy means it disproportionately hits those on low incomes. It is almost a flat tax. The increase of the 21% VAT rate by 0.5% is also regressive. It will hit low income families and does nothing to reverse the State’s dependence on consumption taxes, one of the key contributors to the current public finance difficulties.

Prior to the budget, we had called for all discretionary tax relief schemes to be available at the standard rate. This would have yielded €1 billion to the Exchequer. It is staggering that the Minister only tinkered with this. It is also hard to understand why the Government failed to abolish the ceiling on PRSI. The social insurance fund will come under more pressure until we can get people back into work, and this measure would have provided essential resources.

I am also concerned that there were no firm proposals on utilising the National Pensions Reserve Fund. We called for this money to be used to fund critical infrastructure projects that would improve competitiveness and provide jobs. There is now concern that this fund will be used to help recapitalise the banks. That should not happen. The Minister said that no vested interests were served in this budget, yet the Construction Industry Federation’s demands on cutting commercial stamp duty have been almost wholly met by slashing this tax from 9% to 6%.

We proposed a number of additional revenue producing initiatives, such as increasing motor tax for the highest emitting non-commercial vehicles, increasing the health levy by 1% on those earning more than €100,000 per annum, introducing legislation to end tax-exile status and ending State subsidies to private schools. Denis O’Brien and Bono, two of our biggest tax exiles, will not be perturbed by this budget. Bono’s concern for Africa is laudable, but it is a pity he does not share the same concern for the people in this State.

[465]The fear among the most vulnerable in society that this budget would harm them most has been realised.

I do not blame those tax exiles for availing of the opportunity. I blame the Government for providing it to them. I just felt it was essential to use an example of these multimillionaires swanning around the globe while the Government allows them to pay no tax in this State.

We have all heard the reports that social welfare payments would be frozen, that child benefit would be taxed, that the Department of Social and Family Affairs had the biggest expenditure and is a so-called drain on the public purse strings. This system is meant to aid those in need, whether they have lost their jobs, are part of a family on low income, are elderly, disabled or ill. Social welfare is not charity for the State to dole out at will. It is a right and an entitlement, and the money within the system is put there ever year by taxpayers, conscious of the fact that they might one day need to access it. If the budget of the Department of Social and Family Affairs is rising, the Government should look at why so many are accessing the system, and set about finding solutions to get people off social welfare and back into employment. The Government’s responsibility is not about making savings that will harm the most vulnerable.

This budget did not take that sensible approach. Instead, it chose to make savings by cutting payments like the early child care supplement. This supplement was introduced as a poor attempt at dealing with the lack of a functioning State child care policy. There was no attempt to make this cut equitable. In a recent parliamentary question, I asked how much money would be saved were this payment to be made only to families earning less than €100,000 per annum. The response, based on revenue estimates, was that this process of payment would save the state €71 million. Did the Government undertake any kind of study regarding this proposal before it made this decision, or did it just arbitrarily decide to slash a percentage of the payment to everyone?

The individual payment increases will do nothing to make next year any easier for those struggling with poverty. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul reported a 50% increase in requests for assistance in the first half of 2008. Threshold has highlighted the significant increase in illegal evictions caused by landlords running into mortgage arrears, and a dramatic increase in home repossession. Merchant’s Quay Ireland reported an 11% increase in the number of meals it provided to homeless people this year. Failure to protect our most vulnerable in this budget will do nothing to fix our economy next year. It will merely create more poverty traps, more misery and more social problems in the years to come.

When cuts were mentioned in advance of this budget, the Government stated clearly that they would not affect front line services in health and education. This budget is an attack on our health services. The paltry increase in funding falls far short of clearly identified needs and will undoubtedly lead to deterioration in services. Health cuts were introduced before last year’s budget and have accelerated since. Patients were being turned away this morning from Our Lady of Lourdes hospital in Drogheda because of overcrowding. Deputy Ó Caoláin has learned that a promised and much needed ambulance will not now be provided to Monaghan General Hospital. The orthopaedic unit at Our Lady’s Hospital in Navan looks set to close for [466]four months. The Minister for Health and Children and Professor Brendan Drumm promised that cuts would not affect patient care, but we have not seen any proof. This budget will speed up the process. Patients will suffer and patients will die as a result of this budget.

Far from representing savings, these cuts are shortsighted and will cost more in the long run. The cuts in home help hours and other services in the community for older people will force more of them from their own homes, and into expensive nursing home care, much of which will be subsidised by the State at a huge cost.

The closure of hospital services across the State for weeks on end to stay within HSE budgets is another false economy as hospital staff continue to be paid and facilities maintained while these facilities are closed to patients. I refer to an example from my area. Last Christmas, Navan orthopaedic unit was closed for several months, but the nurses, consultants and other staff were still paid and the only saving was in the replacement body parts, hips and knees, which were to be used. The people who needed those replacements in December when the closure occurred still needed them in January, February, March and April, the only difference being that they were suffering more and the queues were growing longer. This is very poor efficiency and shame on the Government for allowing that to happen and for continuing with that disgraceful policy.

With rising unemployment leading to an increase in the numbers of people eligible for the medical card, it is essential that services for medical card patients are maintained. GPs must be discouraged from setting quotas for medical card holders. It is wrong that entitled families are refused by doctor after doctor. The Government has failed to fulfil its own commitments to index the income thresholds for medical cards to increases in the average industrial wage and double the income limit eligibility of parents of children under six years of age and treble them for parents of children under 18 years of age with an intellectual disability. When the over 70s non-means tested medical card was introduced, Sinn Féin asked why the same principle was not applied to people under 18, people with a range of medical conditions and, indeed, all citizens. This scheme has been withdrawn and that demonstrates the lack of consistency and the inequity at the heart of Government health policy. That will hurt many elderly people who do not meet whatever means criteria are set out for the medial card. It is most unfortunate the Green Party could not exercise more influence to ensure the scheme was continued.

Given the current shortfall in public finances, it is crucial that the Government ends the massive waste of resources and inequality caused by the two tier public-private health system.

The cost to the Exchequer of tax foregone in capital allowances to the developers of private hospitals rose from €1.9 million in 2004 to €10.6 million in 2006, with figures for 2007 and 2008 not yet available. The cost in 2006 alone would fund over 6,000 extra full medical cards for a year. The private hospital co-location scheme is another massive subsidy to the private health business. The cost of tax breaks for these developments is not yet known and it cannot be quantified. The land to which they have been given access is a huge asset which will be lost to the public health system. Ultimately, the only guarantee of equal access and real efficiency in our health services will be fundamental reform and the establishment of a universal public health system, with access based on need alone, free at the point of delivery and funded from general, fair and progressive taxation.

Sinn Féin wants to see the immediate establishment of a health funding commission to report within a year on the costs of the transition to a new single tier public health system with universal provision, taking into account all spending on health services under the current systems, including State funding and spending on private health insurance.

[467]Education is another area which the Government promised to protect from cuts in this budget. Given that the system is barely existing on its current funds, a marginal increase is akin to cuts in real terms. We accept that this is a new economic environment, but the education sector must be considered as part of an overall strategy to reverse the current economic outlook and to ensure the long-term stability of the Irish economy. We cannot build a knowledge economy if we do not invest in knowledge from pre-school up through the system.

Perhaps the most blatant neglect and disregard shown to our young people by the Government is in the area of school buildings. The Minister has effectively deceived the Dáil on this issue. Investment in primary school building was not increased but rather it was reduced by 5%. Public-private partnership costs have gone up by 30%. The recently introduced school building programme is completely inadequate. Only 25 schools are to benefit, which means hundreds of schools will be disappointed. One third of our primary schools have applied for a new school or need building works on their existing school. Glenswilly national school in Donegal has been innovative in its response. It has renamed itself, Seeking an Extension since 1992. Unfortunately, the Government showed no such innovation. I called to St. Joseph’s school in Mell in Drogheda this morning where 211 pupils are crammed into all sorts of closeted conditions. Two cloakrooms have been converted into classrooms. Other pupils wishing to use the toilet are forced to go through those tiny cloakrooms.

I hope that some parties within the Government will seek to change Government policy in this regard. Those children are not receiving an adequate education. Six of the classes in St. Joseph’s school in Mell have more than 30 students.

This programme came on the back of the revelation that many schools that have been given approval for extensions cannot proceed to construction because the funds provided only cover a fraction of the actual cost. The Department of Education and Science spends €35.5 million per annum on prefabricated buildings. That is a complete waste of money. It is money down the drain. I spoke earlier about how the downturn in the domestic building sector provides an opportunity to address historic underfunding of school buildings in a way that will provide real value for money. Now is the time for immediate recommencement of the school building programme to ensure that all schools with unsafe and substandard accommodation are upgraded immediately.

I also draw attention to the inadequate primary capitation grant system. Energy costs, waste disposal charges, water charges, with cleaning and hygiene costs, have increased dramatically and schools can no longer meet those costs. On average, after receiving all funding available from the State, each primary school has an average annual debt of €23,000. That means that €82 million has to be raised by parents, friends and school boards this year to cover the debts of primary schools throughout the State. This places pressure on parents, many of whom are struggling to make ends meet in the current climate. That is a pressure that should not exist in a State with so-called free education. A total of €82 million in this year alone is some free education system.

The Minister’s party with Fianna Fáil and with what is left of the Progressive Democrats has presided over an absolutely disgraceful budget. The Minister of State should have used his influence to make this budget more progressive and effective for the people, but he failed to do so. I am happy to allow him to heckle me because I will call it as it is and I will hold him and the Government to account regardless of whether he likes it.

[468]This budget provides no funding to solve the problem of classroom overcrowding. The programme for Government commits the Government to:

Increase the number of primary teachers by at least 4,000. This will enable us to reduce class sizes.

The Minister of State should tell the children of Mell that. The aim is to reduce class sizes to 24 by 2010-11. There is little chance of this happening, given the attitude of the Government this afternoon. Yet, almost 100,000 children remain in classes of 30 pupils or more. The lack of funding in this sector has also had detrimental effects on the identification of children with special needs and has failed to solve the issue of illiteracy. An estimated 500,000 Irish adults have literacy difficulties. This is an educational crisis. To have any hope of developing the economy, we need to eradicate illiteracy, introduce paid educational leave as a statutory entitlement and make work-based learning and training available to all workers. In yet another budget, the Government has failed to identify the potential for education development and the return it will bring, not just for the next generation but for ourselves.

Given the public finance shortfall, we knew this budget would be tough. I have talked about what has got us into this mess and I have had a go at the Government for decisions it has taken and those they have failed to take. However, when all is said and done, the Sinn Féin Deputies were prepared to come into this Chamber and support measures which we believed offered responsible solutions to the current mess created by the Government.

I appreciate the pressure the Minister for Finance labours under in delivering this budget, but this budget will not turn around the economy. It contains short-sighted and, in many cases, irresponsible measures.

This budget needed to look to the future. It had to deliver a new value for money ethos. It needed to contain a vision for the creation of jobs. It had to deliver funding to those Departments that will help the economy in the long term, namely, the Department of Education and Science and those dealing with the fallout from years of underfunding, such as the Department of Health and Children. Instead, it tinkers at the edges of the crisis, makes cuts where they will hurt the most and displays no real political leadership to get this State back on its feet. We needed a brave budget but instead we have been presented with a blinkered one.

I look forward to continuing the debate on this matter. I also look forward to continuing to hold the Government to account because, by God, that needs to happen.
