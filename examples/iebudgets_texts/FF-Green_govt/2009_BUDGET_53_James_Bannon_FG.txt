I feel I am addressing a wake. There has undoubtedly been a death and, as everyone knows, this is a case of murder most foul, a deliberate act that has left the mourners lost and suffering. Everyone knows the identity of the guilty parties — Fianna Fáil and the Green Party. The death I speak of is that of the Irish economy, which was in robust [126]health and well tended by the hard work of the Irish taxpayer, until it was wantonly and ruthlessly brought down by the current Government. This death was no accident.

Previous speakers have spoken at length about Government blame and about the harsh realities of the budget cutbacks. I would like to look at the threat to our heritage posed by a wilting Green Party Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who has failed yet again to take measures to protect our cultural and historic past, our environmental future and who allowed the Minister for Finance to strike a stunning blow to our heritage.

I am particularly disgusted that the Army barracks in Longford is to close as part of cutbacks to make good the Government’s squandering of the wealth of the boom years. However, the people of Longford have fought to save the barracks before and we will fight again. We will take to the streets in protest. The voice of the people will be heard. Connolly Barracks is an essential part of the economic profile of County Longford and its closure, with the removal of 180 jobs, plus 160 reserve personnel, from the local economy is equivalent to the loss of two major industries in the county.

The people of Longford have been let down by Fianna Fail’s Deputy Peter Kelly who, on several occasions and in the company of the Minister for Defence, gave assurances that the Barracks was secure as long as he was in the Dáil. Deputy Kelly said this on more than one occasion.

How could the Deputy and the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O’Dea, be such hypocrites? If our economy was dependent on the so-called help of Deputy Kelly, Longford would be on the breadline. Shame on him for letting his Government treat the people of Longford in such a way. He has pulled down the shutters on Longford. Ballymahon lost ten jobs today. This proves again that this Government is not committed to Longford.

With jobs going in Longford, perhaps Deputy Kelly’s should be the first to go. He got away with another gimmick in the run-up to the 2002 general election when he promised that an American company, Cardinal Health, would deliver 1,300 jobs to Longford. This never materialised and he never explained to the people of Longford why this did not happen. The loss of 180 jobs, plus 160 reservists, plus ten jobs in Ballymahon, at a time of major economic downturn, will impact on all sectors of our community. Local shops, restaurants, hotels and bars will feel the knock-on effects of the departure of these personnel, with long-term implications for our economic well-being.

As a working barracks situated in an historic building of note, Connolly Barracks generated tourism income, which will also be lost to the area. There was a very small reduction of eight jobs in the live register figures for September with the August figure of 3,286 unemployed standing at a revised figure of 3,278. This hope of improved times ahead has been dashed by the loss of the 180 jobs at the barracks plus ten jobs, leading to a revised figure of 3,468 jobs lost to Longford.

Generations of soldiers and their families have lived and worked in the barracks since the foundation of the State. It is part of the local community. As well as its military role, the barracks is used for many important community and charitable functions.

Connolly Barracks has also played an important part in the history of County Longford. It was established as a cavalry barracks in the 18th and 19th centuries and was renamed Seán Connolly Barracks in 1922. It is currently the home of the 4th cavalry squadron. The barracks is one of the oldest buildings in Longford and is located on the site of the original castle and market house which were erected in 1619.

[127]Granard courthouse was earmarked for closure and now Longford barracks is to go, all this because the Government squandered billions of euro of the taxpayers’ money and wants them to make good its losses at huge expense to the local communities. It is disgusting that Longford is being stripped of these unique heritage assets and local employment. It has contributed to the well-being of the area for many years and has been such an important part of the county’s identity. Such cutbacks will see the pattern repeated throughout the country, as my colleague, Deputy Deenihan said.

The Minister’s disregard for our heritage, which is demonstrated by the 40% budgetary cutback in funding, is also set to affect an unusual historical artefact. The preserved animals in the National Museum of Ireland have fallen victim to recession and cut-backs and will not now get their restorative touch up, leaving rarities such as extinct dodos, who many people insist are alive and well and living in Leinster House, and which has been amply demonstrated by the Government, forced to wait for essential restoration despite their attraction both at their home base and for tourists.

This budget is merely the preliminary round in a succession of measures designed to launch what will be called the Cowen great depression of the new millennium’s first decade, caused by Government squandering and wasting the years of plenty, to be followed now by years of famine. We have no cheer to look forward to. The winter of discontent will in due course come to its natural conclusion at the polls.

As things stand, it looks like the grey vote will be the driving force behind the Government’s downfall. Thousands of pensioners who have previously held a medical card have had it whipped out of their hands by a heartless and uncaring Government which is now demanding €100 per hospital visit from the sick and vulnerable. How does that balance out with a meagre €7 increase in pensions?

There is huge discontent within the Government ranks, with Ministers falling over themselves to justify the indefensible. How can any Government justify saving €100 million at the expense of the deaths of pensioners unable to afford medical care? The opportunity cost for many pensioners of purchasing medical care will be food and fuel; the opportunity cost of food and fuel will be medical care. This is a lose-lose situation. The Government, however, will bring itself down, with Deputy Brian Lenihan blaming Deputy Mary Harney and so on. I predict they will shaft Deputy Mary Harney as surely as they shafted Charlie McCreevy. The gang of 22 is waiting in the wings and we will hear more about this when they come back here next week.

This is a budget where those who saw none of the benefits of the boom years are being hit yet again. What about the disabled?

I wish to draw attention of this House to the plight of an intellectually disabled young adult who, having finished school, is left with no provision for his future.

[128]I am thinking here of a letter I received recently from a lady whose son will graduate from a special school next June and, much to her despair, there is no guarantee of funding for him beyond this date. There is no guaranteed respite services, no funding for the opening of residential services and no future for either this boy or his parents.

There is further bad news concerning education. The Minister for Education and Science had the power to remove the onus on middle income earners and re-introduce third level fees for top earners. Instead the reality is a shameful half measure of increasing registration fees, which will once again adversely impact on middle income earners who are already bearing the brunt of this budget.

This Government backed off once again from making the wealthy pay their way. So much for the promise that any increase would only impact on those on an income in excess of €120,000.

No matter what this increase is called, it is fees by the back door and Deputy Finneran will have to bear the brunt when he goes back to Roscommon tomorrow evening.

It is a case of stealth and more stealth. That is all that can be expected from a Fianna Fáil Government. They act like a shower of hypocrites in this Chamber.
