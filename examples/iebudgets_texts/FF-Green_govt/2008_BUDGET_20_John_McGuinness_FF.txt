I commend the budget to the House. We have had a lengthy debate on what turned out to be a very prudent budget from the Minster, Deputy Cowen. It is a budget for its time and reflects what is needed for the economy as we approach a difficult period in 2008.

Deputy Kenny referred this morning to the public service and then attempted to drive a wedge between me and my party with regard to comments I had made.

In his speech he showed no courage whatsoever with regard to putting forward a vision for this country and explaining where he believes either the Government or Opposition should be going. He said little or nothing of substance, yet he continued to chase lurid headlines and jump on bandwagons in an effort to gain some sort of notoriety for his party.

I listened carefully because I am not afraid to admit that some of his suggestions with regard to reform of the public service are absolutely necessary, and are similar to opinions I had voiced previously. However, he presented his opinion as if that opinion was only expressed by the Opposition, which is simply untrue. It has been expressed time and again by members of my party and by Ministers, including the Minister for Finance. We all recognise that. It is a question of who is prepared to take the steps to bring about that reform.

Fianna Fáil and the Minister for Finance have indicated clearly the need for that reform. If all parties in this House were to recognise this and put action behind their words, they would support us in the effort to bring about the change that is necessary to create a dynamic public service that will deliver in this time of need.

This is not a criticism of public servants. It is, in fact, a liberation of those who serve in the public service. It gives them the opportunity to play a central role in the reform of this country. Together with the unions, the Opposition and the Government, we can bring about what is necessary in the context of delivering the policies and spend for this country that will make business prosper and give us a better quality of life.

Deputy Kenny referred to value for money, but he is not the first in the House to do so. It is an issue that has been taken up by the Committee of Public Accounts in the past five years, as Deputy Hayes will know. Considerable change has resulted from the work of that committee. Its members have highlighted the loss to the Government and the State which resulted from contracts not coming in on time, overspending on contracts and so on. Through the work of the committee, we have seen new contracts put in place and major roads infrastructure coming in on time and within budget.

We have also seen changes in the Department of Finance. No longer are the views of the committee simply expressed; they are minuted by the Department of Finance and a detailed, comprehensive response is received on the issues validly raised by the committee.

The Opposition should not be afraid to recognise the valuable work and achievements of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Government. That would take an Opposition which is not only there to oppose, but also to put forward policies and recognise where right is being done in the context of Government policy. In yesterday’s debate, no reference was made by the Opposition to the 1,300 net jobs being created. What we had was a litany of misinformation and the misquotation of statistics, which were taken out of context and presented in a way designed to embarrass the Government.

Outside in the real world there is an acknowledgement of the success of Government policy in regard to, for example, the SME sector. Yet, on the other side of the House yesterday, there was nothing but criticism and no acknowledgement of the achievements of the Government and small businesses, which work to pay their taxes so they can be spent on projects designed for the betterment of the people.

It is a shame on the Opposition that it would not recognise what is happening and would criticise the constructive work that has been undertaken by the commercial sector in this country.

The Opposition criticised the constructive work being undertaken by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, organisations which go to the coalface with Irish and foreign companies and impress on them the need to do more business in Ireland. Those organisations are successful in their efforts.

I have attended a number of trade missions since my appointment in July. I have worked with many small companies which supply software packages for security systems in world banks. Those small companies are represented in the context of the jobs they are creating at home. With Enterprise Ireland, they are doing a successful job for Ireland. However, there was no mention by the Opposition yesterday of the facts of the case, just distortion.

There was not one word from the members of the Opposition on the latest achievement of the IDA, namely, the investment of €200 million and the creation of 170 jobs at Merck Sharp & Dohme through the development of a 65-acre site in Carlow. They simply talked down the economy in an attempt to talk it into recession for cheap political gain.

The members of the Opposition must learn from the facts of commerce. There is a clear story to be told but they did not tell it because they were afraid to do so.

They should have the courage to stand up and give support where it is necessary. They are afraid to do so because they are hurt by the facts. What they seem to forget is that the people know the truth; they know of the jobs we are creating and the tax they are paying, and they know they are successful, against the odds doing all of this business, are the ones who look at the House and tell us how foolish the Opposition look in the context of what is being achieved.

The Opposition refuses to listen to the truth or acknowledge what is going on. It does not understand that the people who are at the coalface, doing all this business are the ones who come in here and tell us how foolish the Opposition looks, given what has been achieved.

The sooner the Opposition starts to acknowledge all that, the sooner we will have better debate in this House. As regards value for money, what kind of example is Fine Gael setting when its Deputies seek electronic voting and then proceed to push everyone through the lobby?

What example is Fine Gael giving concerning value for money when its Deputies bring ridiculous motions before the House and refuse to acknowledge the truth.

Fine Gael displays poor value for money, poor leadership and no vision whatsoever. The party’s Deputies attempt to jump on every single bandwagon that is running.

The Deputy is the man who has most to say about everything, yet nothing to say about anything. I commend the budget to the House and I ask for a more constructive Opposition.
