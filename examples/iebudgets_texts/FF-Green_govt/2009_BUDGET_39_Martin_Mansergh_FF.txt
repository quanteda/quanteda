The backdrop to the budget is the serious financial situation at home and the turmoil on the global markets. Even after the budget measures are implemented the projected general Government debt is €12 billion or 6.5% of GDP. If nothing had been done the deficit would have been 8%. That has necessitated serious expenditure reductions but also €2 billion in tax increases. It will take us until 2011 to get back on track in terms of getting the deficit down below the 3% threshold. Growth should resume when the contraction in the housing sector is out of the system.

The prosperity of the past 20 years was based on the decision in 1987 and 1988 to put the public finances on a healthy footing. The credit for that goes to the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, and the then Minister for Finance, Ray MacSharry, with the support of Alan Dukes and the Tallaght strategy from the Opposition benches, given that there was a minority Government. The public finances went remarkably quickly on to a solid foundation. That has been one of the principal bases for the spectacular employment growth, the substitution of a low tax system for a high tax system and the vastly increased expenditure and improvement in public services. I make that point to underline the fact that we have to pull back the rapid deterioration and not allow it to become a runaway horse, otherwise we will spend years trying to correct the situation, as happened through most of the 1980s.

At the same time, the Government does not want to put the economy into a deeper depression. The budget has involved difficult and painful decisions. It is undoubtedly an observable fact that different sections of the community and different interests of all types always feel they are a special case and that the burden should fall on somebody else. The favourite scapegoats seem to be either the rich or, increasingly, the public service. The reality is it falls on everyone to make a contribution. I understand the Opposition parties feel no particular obligation to come up with a coherent alternative concept and Governments are there to take responsibility. However, I certainly find the Fine Gael position as incredible as the Taoiseach did yesterday.

Fine Gael wants a lower borrowing requirement, no tax increases and no reductions in capital expenditure.

It seems the entire burden is to fall on reform of the public sector, which is not capable of producing results as quickly as Fine Gael suggests.

I well remember in 1994 the Fine Gael Party opposed the then partnership agreement and when, unexpectedly, it came into office the following year it executed very smartly a complete U-turn on the subject and supported the agreement. The reality is that the Fine Gael position——

——has no support from the Labour Party benches and would not be followed through if Fine Gael were to find itself in coalition government.

I wish to address the broad principle of the issue of the day, the withdrawal of automatic entitlement to medical cards——

——for people over 70 years. Even with this measure the cost of medical cards will rise by 14% next year. I favoured its introduction, mainly on grounds of the reassurance it would give to people whose medical problems, on average, increase with age.

Going back to the 1940s and the 1950s the medical profession mostly opposed, with success, the introduction of a universal health care system here such as the national health service across the water. As Parliamentary Secretary, Dr. Ward, was responsible for pioneering the health service here from 1932 to 1946 but he was brought down by a so-called scandal induced by medical interests. A few years later Dr. Browne was also effectively brought down by the same profession that earned, and still does earn, a very comfortable income from the better off members of the community.

For better or for worse, therefore, we did not opt for an NHS-type of service, although those systems also have plenty of problems of their own, as do mostly private or insurance-based systems. We ended up with what can best be described as a dual, mixed system with considerable overlaps. Approximately 50% of the population, if not more, have health insurance assisted by tax breaks together with some public entitlements. Should this system be departed from, let us say for the under 18s or the over 70s the case can certainly be made, especially when resources are abundant, but there is also an argument as to whether either constitute the best use of resources. The medical card was introduced a few years ago for the over 70s but it faced palpable reluctance from the medical profession then led by an IMO president who is now the Fine Gael health spokesperson, who insisted on disproportionate compensation.

[85]To be fair——

——it obtained it. That does not mean it was the right decision.

It was a bridge too far——

I am trying to argue this rationally——

——as, arguably, was free university fees even for higher income brackets. In hindsight, I believe it was a mistake.

It is not simply a question of the €100 million which will be saved this year, but the prospect of escalating costs in future years. It is important that those who left VHI schemes should be able to return without delay and with minimum difficulty.

People comfortably situated, owning their own home with no child dependants and an income well above the State pension, can continue as previously with insurance and the various schemes that limit, reimburse or give credit for higher levels of medical expenses. I accept in individual cases financial difficulty, worry and sacrifice may be involved.

Ultimately, it is a question of what level of social services we can provide with the sort of finances available. I regret that some people of a certain age group were given expectations which it is now not possible for us to fulfil, and this is a warning to those on all sides of the House——

——that when one is in Government, one should not introduce measures which may gain considerable kudos at the time, but which prove to be unsustainable.

Another controversial issue is the 1% levy. This was introduced albeit with a threshold both in 1983 by the Fine Gael and Labour coalition and in 1993 by the Fianna Fáil and Labour coalition.

[86]I remember the 1% levy in the first budget of the Fianna Fáil and Labour coalition was the centrepiece——

——of the financing of that budget. The view behind it is that anyone with an income outside of State benefits should be in a position to contribute 1%——

This is because if one has a small income, the amount is only nominal. Let us say one works two or three hours per week outside of other entitlements and earns, for example, €60. The 1% levy amounts to 60 cent. The idea that this will bring ruin and tribulation on anyone is not the case.

At higher levels it does, which is the whole point. It raises substantial amounts of income. If one earns €100,000 per year, the levy raises €1,000 and if one earns €200,000, it raises €3,000. It is calculated on gross income and there are no allowances, exemptions or whatever to get in the way of collecting the money.

It brings home the point that we all benefit from society and all must contribute in however small a way. I welcome the budget measures which mean that, apart from the levy, those on the minimum wage will stay outside the tax net. Similarly, those on the average industrial wage will be exempt from the standard rate band.

The affirmation of no change to the corporation tax rate is very important in retaining Ireland’s attractiveness for inward investment and, given the other tax changes, it is important to state this fact. This has been amplified by the research and development incentive which will reduce the impact of the 12.5% corporation tax in real terms. I am pleased that substantial funding continues to be provided for research, infrastructure improvements and school buildings among the budget priorities. Since June 2007, several thousand extra teachers have been recruited.

In comparing the situation to the past, one needs to take into account that there has been much improvement and we now have special assistants, resource teachers and so on. They alleviate the burden on the classroom teacher.

Changes in the social welfare package amounted to €0.5 billion. The main increases were more than 3%, ahead of the rate of inflation. This amounts to an 8.4% increase in social welfare spending, which allowed the pension to increase by €7 to €230 per week. I also welcome the [87]changes, if modest, in the fuel allowance. The significant improvements made in the past ten years in child benefit and the introduction of the early childhood supplement have, for the vast majority of people, been maintained. There has only been a little trimming at the edges.

I especially welcome the reduced excise on low-alcohol beer and cider. Bulmers cider is very important in my constituency.

The increase of 8 cent on petrol will be avoided by those with diesel vehicles and it will encourage a movement in that direction. This is one of many environmental measures and incentives in the budget.

I welcome the maintenance of the commitment to development aid.

I return to the subject of the public service. There is a notion propagated, more outside the House than inside, in certain newspapers that we have a vast, bloated public service. The reality is that compared to other countries the numbers in the public service are limited. It is barely more than 10% of the workforce, or if one includes teachers and those who work in hospitals, between 14% and 15%. There is an ideological bias and I am sorry that Fine Gael seems to have bought into this thinking to a certain extent.


I have not repudiated anything. What Government policy is this?


The public service in recent times has served the country remarkably well.

I had an opportunity to observe this at close quarters when attending the IMF World Bank meeting in Washington in recent days. Officials there worked in tandem with officials on this side of the Atlantic in preparation for a meeting in Paris. Along with the political leadership given, we have been very well served in underpinning and sustaining our financial system under remarkable pressures. Some people talk about the public service without having any close experience of it.

However, the public service is facing reform, but it is not a short-term exercise. The budget is reducing and amalgamating several agencies. This is not a reflection on the people involved [88]or the good work they have done in the past, but a question of how the work is best carried on in future with the amount of resources available. I am also pleased to say something which is only half comprehended by some organs of opinion and some people in the House. The decentralisation process has been consolidated. Some 6,000 jobs will be decentralised. It was originally planned to relocate approximately 11,000 jobs.

There are many projects in progress. They are of significant value to the towns in which they are located. Deputy Varadkar said he would prefer to scrap decentralisation and concentrate on broadband. While broadband is important, that view is not shared by the people of my home town.

I am glad the budget for flood relief works has been maintained. The Office of Public Works will continue to service its various properties through its heritage service. Like all other budgets, the arts budget has had to bear some sacrifices. The allocation that has been made will help us to maintain a broad range of cultural activity and employment. I wish to pay tribute to the Ceann Comhairle for the work he did when he served as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. The Government recognises that the arts are integral to the well-being and identity of our society, rather than an optional extra or a luxury to be dispensed with in difficult times.
