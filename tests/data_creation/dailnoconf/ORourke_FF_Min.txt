I very much welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. I would like to place on record the outstanding achievements of  this Government in meeting educational needs. On taking up office as Minister for Education I set myself a number of targets. First, I wished to bring about change, not by diktat or confrontation but through consultation and collaboration with all concerned.

The Primary Review Body and Primary Curriculum Review Body, representative of all concerned with education at the primary level, were set up to advise on future developments at that level. Many of the recommendations in their immensely valuable reports are already being implemented; others will be carried forward in the Green Paper on Education. Similarly the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment were set up, again representative of all concerned interests, to advise initially on developments at the second level and more recently to follow on the work of the Primary Curriculum Review Body.

The process of consultation has been ongoing outside of these formal arrangements - with teachers, managerial bodies and parents. I sought not only consultation but involvement of all in the planning of education and in its management. Illustrative of this are the measures I have taken to involve teachers and parents in the vocational education committees and in the management of schools through the boards of management. I am particularly pleased at the immense strides that have been made in parental involvement, at the school level and in planning at national level.

Second, I sought to initiate an education system which was more caring, which addressed the needs of all our young people and which was more user-friendly for those who were not participating fully. I want to ensure that each individual is provided with the opportunity of developing her/his potential to the greatest possible extent.

Let me illustrate some of the important measures which have been undertaken to achieve this objective: funding for the special assistance scheme for schools in disadvantaged areas has increased by 300 per cent since 1987. The home school links programme which I launched as a  major part of this scheme is already having encouraging results. This year I have expanded the programme to bring it to a total of 80 schools and arrangements are in hand to extend it to second level schools; within the past three years some 325 additional teachers have been authorised for primary schools in disadvantaged areas and for remedial education; a pilot school psychological service for primary schools has been initiated in the west Tallaght-Clondalkin area and in South Tipperary where there are some 28,000 pupils enrolled. This development is being carefully monitored and evaluated in line with the recommendations of the Psychological Society in Ireland. In the present year 325 teaching posts were authorised in order to reduce class sizes in primary schools; at post-primary level some 120 schools have each been provided with the services of an extra teacher to assist in aspects of disadvantage within those schools; to reduce the PTR in post-primary schools a further 250 teaching posts were sanctioned this year. I should add that, at present there are some 1,000 teachers approved for post-primary schools outside the normal quota provision to meet particular curricula, remedial and other needs; I have continued to expand the free books scheme. More than 250,000 children are now benefiting under the scheme at primary level and post-primary level, with total expenditure now standing at over £4 million annually; I have created a special fund to foster and encourage greater participation in senior cycle and third level education/training programmes for students from disadvantaged areas. At the same time the various curricular initiatives have been aimed at providing courses more effectively planned to meet the needs of all our young people.

The new junior certificate will come into effect in 1992 and, for the first time, will provide a common curricular framework for all students with different subject options and levels so as to ensure that all needs will be met. Similarly at  senior cycle level, major reforms are proposed, again with the objective of providing for all ability levels. New leaving certificate and senior cycle programmes are being prepared to provide a range of curricular options. A major development for all students starting second level this year is the availability of a six year cycle. This is a major initiative which has been long needed and warmly welcomed.

Some 75 per cent of all students now sit the leaving certificate examination. For those who are successful a range of further educational opportunities are available. I shall be speaking later about the third level sector. Let me mention here the very successful development of the post-secondary vocational preparation and training programmes. Some 13,500 students go into these programmes or more than half again of the number entering third level education. To aid this number of students I have recently announced the establishment of a national certifying body - the National Council for Vocational Awards. This council will include representatives of all interested parties, including the social partners to ensure that courses reflect the needs of industry.

As a final point, for those who left school prematurely a variety of opportunities are available ranging from literacy and community programmes, through Youthreach and the vocational training opportunities scheme. The latter is geared specifically towards the long term unemployed. Youthreach and the vocational training opportunities scheme were commenced in 1989 and since then have undergone major expansion. The number on the Youthreach progrmme has increased from 600 to 1,600 and on the vocational training opportunities scheme from 60 to 1,060, with plans for further expansion.

Let me turn now to third level education. Here I set upon a path in 1989 to implement a three year plan for completion by 1992. I wanted to simplify the whole process of entry to third level education combined with a major expansion in the number of places. The process  started once again through consultation and dialogue with concerned interests. The Taoiseach and I met with the university authorities in 1989 initially to emphasise Government commitment to third level expansion and to seek their co-operation. This initiative resulted in the setting up of a working group and later in agreement on an undergraduate expansion programme to provide not fewer than 3,600 additional university places.

At the same time I began broader based consultations to simplify and coordinate entry procedures for all third level colleges. The consultations involved the heads of universities, IVEA, AVEC, the principals of VEC third level colleges, teachers' unions and students' unions. A plan of action was agreed for implementation over the three year period 1990-92 and included:

-a common system of application for third level places, through an expansion of the CAO and which has resulted in the CAO-CAS system covering both universities and VEC third level colleges;

-the inclusion of all other third level colleges, for example teacher training colleges, in the admissions system by 1992;

-the adoption of a common grading system by all institutions for the purpose of points for admission;

-the avoidance of accumulation of points over a number of years by limiting choice to the points gained in one sitting of the leaving certificate;

-the further simplification of the system by eliminating interviews except in exceptional circumstances such as art courses.

This process of simplification and coordination is virtually complete and will be completed next year, 1992.

Again in parallel I instituted other discussions to set in train the process which has resulted in the recent legislation,  which was most generously and graciously agreed by all sides of the House, to merge Thomond College with the University of Limerick. It is clear that this will have a beneficial spin-off for all concerned as well as providing 600 additional university places. I should add that I took this action not long after I had brought the long running saga of the upgrading of the NIHEs to university status to a happy conclusion. As the House is aware this was the first instance of the creation of a university since the foundation of the State. I did it on the double for good measure. Again this was achieved through the co-operation and consensus of all parties in this House.

I took also a hard look at the position of the remaining two major primary teacher training colleges in the light of the reduced demand for teacher training places. I considered that appropriate linkage between each college and the university was the correct way forward and I am pleased that the Government agreed with this approach. The discussions which I put in train between the teacher training colleges and the universities are now well advanced. I am hopeful that the talks between Mary Immaculate teacher training college and the University of Limerick and St. Patrick's teacher training college and Dublin City University will have a satisfactory outcome with the potential for providing more than 1,000 further third-level places.

At the same time I was conscious of the need to expand physical facilities in line with the expansion in third level places. I have already mentioned the additional accommodation available in Thomond College and the primary teacher training colleges. The acquisition of Carysfort offered further potential and as I will point out later resulted in the provision of more than 600 additional places.

In addition to those efforts I was pleased to receive Government agreement for two additional initiatives. The first related to the university expansion programme to provide 3,600 additional places for which the Government are allocating £15 million over a five year  period. That initiative has been in place for two years. The second is the major capital expansion programme supported by the EC Structural Fund. In current cost terms this amounts to £85 million and is being implemented over the period 1990-93. It includes the new Tallaght RTC which will open in 1992 and which, over a few years will provide more than 1,000 new places. The remainder of the programme includes projects throughout the universities and VEC third level colleges.

I should mention here the collaboration which has developed between our third level institutions and industry in research and development. The importance of this collaboration is reflected in major investment in science and technology projects in the third level sector. Investment amounting to about £20 million comes from my colleagues in the Departments of Industry and Commerce and the Marine.

Before leaving this topic I wish to refer to the legislation which I hope will be introduced in the House within the next few weeks. I hope the Whips will be able to agree to it. Again like the other legislation on education which we had the honour to participate in, I hope it will be mutually agreeable. This legislation is important in that it will place the colleges on a sound legislative footing for the first time and give them responsibility for their own day to day management. It will also provide them with the authority and the necessary framework to develop their efforts in research and development.

Let me touch on the question of private sector funding for third level projects. I welcome the growing initiatives in this area. The education sector is, as I have mentioned, making a major contribution to industry in research and development. Residential accommodation for students available now on most university campuses is an example of this. I am happy that I was able to give support and encouragement for this initiative particularly without having to pay the bill.

The various initiatives mentioned earlier were aimed at major expansion in third level places. This year we have  almost 40 per cent of the age group entering third level education by comparison with 20 per cent in 1980 and 25 per cent in 1986. When the programme I have outlined is fully implemented about 45 per cent of that age group will be entering third level education. When I took office in 1987 there were 56,000 students in third-level education. There are now 75,000, an increase of 34 per cent. With the measures already in train this number is likely to increase to 90,000. This is an extraordinary expansion which was brought about, as I have said, by a process of co-operation, dialogue and consensus between all participants. Six hundred of the new places will become available on the Belfield campus as a result of the purchase of Carysfort and the transfer there of the Graduate School of Business. Indeed these 600 places are a minimum and I would hope to see that significantly increased. In addition almost 100 of the 140 residential places there are already in use by students with the remainder being brought into use very quickly. It was in the interest of achieving these additional places that I continued to pursue the question of acquiring Carysfort from 1987 until 1990. Much has been written about all of this. As often happens in these matters there has been speculation, inaccuracies and indeed misrepresentation of the facts. I will not use unparliamentary words in this debate as they are not allowed so I have used the words in my speech.

Since I came to office there have been Adjournment debates in relation to Carysfort on 20 February 1988, on 20 July 1989, and on 17 May 1990. Again it was discussed on the Supplementary Estimate in December 1990 and was warmly welcomed and voted on by Deputies Jimmy Deenihan and Eamon Gilmore. I gave a detailed oral answer to a question on this matter on 12 February 1991 and I have replies to numerous other written parliamentary questions in regard to it. In addition I have participated in two debates in the Dáil and in two radio interviews on this subject. I wish to take this opportunity in the House again to set the record straight on the matter. The real  scandal of Carysfort College was the precipitate manner of its closure in 1986 by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government. That was done without any warning, consultation or preparation.

I hope that I shall not be interrupted.

No attempt was made to link Carysfort with a third level college so as to ensure its capacity and facilities would be properly and fully utilised. Those are the types of links, as I mentioned earlier, which I am now seeking to establish for St. Patrick's and Mary Immaculate in Limerick. This Government are determined that the ineptitude displayed by the then Government will not happen again.

 The record shows that since the precipitate closure of the college I have always been committed to the retention of Carysfort as a third level institution. Within a week of taking up office I had detailed discussions with the authorities of the Mercy Order in the context of the working group established by the Minister who succeeded Minister Hussey, Deputy Paddy Cooney, to whom I give full respect for his efforts in that regard. It is interesting to note that the principal thrust of the proposals in the report was the use of the Carysfort premises and facilities for the operation of appropriate courses under the aegis of UCD. In the event the proposals in the report of that time proved unacceptable to the authorities of the Mercy Order.

Since that time I have been unrelenting in pursuing every available option and opportunity. On 5 and 12 June 1987 I held further meetings with the authorities of the Mercy Order but, unfortunately, agreement could not be reached.

On 10 March 1988 a meeting was held between Sister Regina, the then president of Carysfort; the Taoiseach; Deputy James Tunney - your good self - and myself. Following that meeting a working group was established to examine a proposal presented at that meeting by Sister Regina that a National College of Music and Dramatic Arts be established at the college.

The working group reported on 29 April. Their proposals, while worthy, would not have been sufficient to fully utilise the extensive premises. In the context of that report the Government, on 28 July 1988, decided that I should come forward with more comprehensive proposals, including use for UCD. From then on the concentration of effort was to try to secure the agreement of the Mercy Order for the leasing of the premises with the necessary flexibility to allow them to be used for third level education. Such flexibility would have been required before UCD could be asked to formulate any proposals. I was unable to secure this because the Mercy Order wished, in effect - and they had every right to do so - to retain right of approval over  educational activities carried out in their premises were they so leased. Their reservations would have included such issues as the type of courses offered and approval of staff taken on - all kinds of matters that were not acceptable to UCD. Discussions on this matter were ongoing at the time the property was offered for sale on the open market on 21 June 1989. I wish to state that the Mercy Order had every right, if they so wished, to put their property on the market; they owned it. In fact, a letter as late as 5 May 1989 from my Department continued to seek the agreement of the Mercy Order to the flexible use of the premises.

In the course of an Adjournment Debate on 20 July 1989 I was urged very strongly by Deputy Barnes, Deputy Gilmore and Deputy Barrett to ensure that the college would be retained for educational purposes. Deputy Gilmore represented that I should enter negotiations in the matter, while Deputy Barrett twice pointed out that if necessary the State should pay £20 million and purchase the whole property.

In the course of my reply to the debate I reiterated the Government's continued interest in securing the use of Carysfort premises for educational purposes with whatever element of the site would be considered appropriate. In conclusion, at that debate I undertook to reopen discussions between my Department and the Mercy Order, and that we did.

The discussions were, in fact, reopened and resulted in the premises and 15 acres of land being offered to my Department by the Mercy Order for £8.5 million. An additional £1.5 million was being sought for the additional five acres of land which would be required. The offer price for the building and 20 acres of land was £10 million. This was in the latter part of August 1989.

Negotiations broke down because of the price and the timescale. The property was then sold into private hands.

In late October 1989 my Department were approached by the agent for the new owner, who, it subsequently transpired, were Davmac Developments Ltd., to  explore our interest in any future use of Carysfort. The approach resulted in an offer for sale on behalf of the new owners of the Carysfort premises and 20 acres for £8.25 million.

All of the matters which I relate are documented and available. I must at this point refute the allegation made on 11 October 1991 by Deputy Gilmore - and I do not do this in a party political sense. I am just saying that he is a Deputy of the House and I am refuting it in that respect - that the property could have been purchased for £6.5 million. No offer at that price was ever made to my Department.

In the course of an Adjournment Debate on 17 May Deputy Gilmore appealed to me to purchase not only the premises and 20 acres of land but to consider purchasing as much of the remainder of Carysfort Park as would come back on the market. The latter part of his request, he said, related to local feelings about the undesirability of having houses built on the land--

Very laudable sentiments, Deputy Gilmore. He also referred to the perceived necessity in some quarters to preserve the green space amenity.

Suggestions were made that my Department should itself purchase Carysfort. This suggestion was not feasible since my Department do not directly operate third level colleges. We had tried it with the College of Music, which would be under the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee. I shall go on to that. A further consideration was that unless a definite use for the premises had been established before its acquisition substantial maintenance costs would have arisen. We examined it in detail and a technical study was made to find our whether it would be suitable for a regional college. It was not suitable for this purpose. I emphasise that all of these submissions and letters are available for perusal.

As the President of UCD noted in his recent statement, the situation changed in 1990 when financial problems arose. I met with representatives of UCD in early September 1990. In a number of meetings over a short period of time it became clear to me and to UCD that up to 600 additional undergraduate student places could be provided at the Belfield campus if UCD could secure Carysfort for its graduate business school.

My notes now go on to quote the letter, but I know I am coming to the end of my time and as the letter has already been published I think that that can be passed over. It can be read, of course.

The £8 million purchase price does not accurately reflect the value of securing  this fine facility for public education. When account is taken of the £2 million available from UCD and of the £1.75 million recovered by the State from the Mercy Order for earlier capital investment, the actual cost to the State was £4.25 million.

The additional moneys made available to UCD for legal fees, adaptation, equipment and maintenance would have been required, no matter for what educational purpose the State had acquired the premises.

The Government considered this matter on 4 December and decided that the Minister for Finance and I should pursue the matter further. The statement by the president of UCD to which I have already referred confirms that he met the Taoiseach and myself on 12 December. Here I would like to make just one interjection. I consider it very odd that the Taoiseach has been called to book because he spoke with Dr. Masterson. Throughout his four year period in office former Taoiseach, Deputy Dr. FitzGerald, a revered and honoured member of the National University of Ireland Senate, was a very regular attender. Why is it so odd that the Taoiseach of the day should talk to Dr. Patrick Masterson? Dr. Masterson went on to point out that, at that meeting, far from exerting pressure, the Taoiseach expressed the view that the proposal was so benefical that the college should commit itself to raising independently a greater proportion of the cost.

Following normal procedures the necessary Supplementary Estimate was agreed between my Department and the Department of Finance.

On 18 December 1990  this House passed a Supplementary Estimate of £9.7 million.

As I was urged to do on a number of occasions, I have made every effort to retain Carysfort College as an educational institution which I have achieved.

It has been established that no pressure was exerted by the Government on UCD. I can assure the House that the premises, and the 20 acres of land, were never on offer to me, or my Department, for less than the £8 million paid subsequently by UCD. Let me reiterate that all requisite policies and procedures were strictly adhered to, which fact was confirmed at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts yesterday.

The moneys were voted in the normal way by the Dáil and made available, again in the normal way, through the Higher Education Authority.

As the Secretary of my Department said in his statement to the Committee of Public Accounts yesterday, the purchase was excellent value for money--

The purchase was excellent value for money.

I reiterate that all requisite policies and procedures were strictly adhered to. The moneys were voted in the normal way by the Dáil and made available in the normal fashion, through the Higher Education Authority, to UCD. The purchase was excellent value for money. Carysfort is now a public asset, as so many Members of this House had long sought. It is now a public educational asset. In the process leading to the purchase--

There were no meetings, correspondence or agreements of any kind between myself, my officials, the vendors or their agents. All such contacts were between UCD, the vendors or their agents. The saga of Carysfort College is over.

I should like to wish all those who lecture there, who will live and learn there every success and fulfilment.
