```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
require(quanteda)
```

## Compare

```{r}
toks_old <- tokenize(toLower(data_char_inaugural[c(2, 40)]), removePunct = TRUE)
toks_new <- tokens(toLower(data_char_inaugural[c(2, 40)]), removePunct = TRUE)
```

Hashed version is definitely smaller:
```{r}
object.size(toks_old)
object.size(toks_new)
```

## So where is the hashing??

but the tokens don't appear to be hashed, although it does have the `types` attribute:
```{r}
str(toks_old)
str(toks_new)

is.character(toks_new[[1]])
```

Or look at this:
```{r}
str(quanteda::tokens_hash(tokenize(c("this is a sample sentence to tokenize"))))
```

## But it all seems to work...

All code using the hashed tokens appears to work still:
```{r}
txt <- c(doc1 = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.",
         doc2 = "The dog jumped and ate the fox.")
toks_new <- tokens(toLower(txt), removePunct = TRUE)
tokens_select(toks_new, "the")
tokens_compound(toks_new, list(c("^jump", ".+")), valuetype = "regex")
tokens_ngrams(toks_new, n = 1:2, skip = 0:1)
```

## Can you solve the mystery?
