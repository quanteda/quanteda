Our nation's peoples are of many backgrounds. As we seek to achieve a land of true equal opportunity, our shared vision--of a nation where folk of differing ethnicities strive, in an atmosphere of fairness untainted by discrimination, to achieve their dreams--has become palpable for many ethnic groups that faced real, and sometimes quite virulent, prejudice when they first immigrated nearly a century and more ago. Yet, for other groups, the effects and continuing reality of bias and discrimination have shown a dogged persistence. Even  [*2]  though these minority groups have a long history in this nation--longer than many groups that have seen the animosity toward them largely dissipate--they continue to be viewed as distinct from the white multi-ethnic majority and to experience recurrent discrimination as a result of their perceived difference. Latinos, present in significant numbers in this country since at least the mid-nineteenth century, are, like African Americans and Native Americans, among these minority groups. 

The marks of these groups' persistent treatment as different lie in their significant underrepresentation in the ranks of the educated, powerful, and wealthy. For example, Latinos--despite their longevity in this nation--continue to show the lowest college-going rates and the lowest socioeconomic profile. This experience of ongoing exclusion does not result from any group choice, nor from any group deficit in potential or ability. Those who suggest otherwise betray their faithlessness in our shared vision of a nation built by and for equals. Rather, this exclusion stems from persistent discrimination and treatment as different. This has resulted, unsurprisingly, in the development of a different experience within the groups that have faced such persistent ostracism. Thus, members of these groups, such as Latinos, bring a perspective shaped by their status as part of a group so marked. While this shared and race-influenced perspective does not result in unanimous opinion or viewpoint on any issue, it does mean that Latinos have an undeniable contribution to make to the diversity of experience sought by many institutions, such as the University of Michigan. Because this special perspective lies in an experience shaped by racial/ethnic difference and the broader community's cognizance and reinforcement of that difference, it can only be fully incorporated by considering race. Capturing  [*3]  the true diversity of our nation requires some reasonable amount of race-consciousness. 

These communities' different experience, shaped by exclusion and ostracism, also means that many purportedly neutral criteria for determining merit or potential do not show the same reliability when applied to minority groups like Latinos, African Americans, and Native Americans. Yet, universities continue to adhere to these criteria, even where they show little correlation with future success. It is appropriate for a university that chooses to continue to use these criteria--for reasons of cost-effectiveness, indifference, or discriminatory design--to consider and adopt race-conscious policies to make up for the race-linked flaws of these criteria. 

This is appropriate not simply because it is just and brings the admissions process closer to a fair and even-handed merit system, but also because educational institutions, as critical shapers of societal values, bear a unique responsibility to take strong and sure steps to eliminate the persistent societal discrimination that continues to ostracize minority groups that have borne these burdens for so long. When educators have finally succeeded at that endeavor, we will know it by the elimination of the hardy and significant underrepresentation of particular groups. When that happens, we will also know that we have, collectively, gotten much closer to our shared vision of a land of truly equal opportunity. 

ARGUMENT 
  
I. LATINOS HAVE A DISTINCT IDENTITY SHAPED BY HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. 

Today, few would deny Justice Lewis Powell's assertion a quarter century ago that admitting students of  [*4]  diverse backgrounds "may bring to a . . . school . . . experiences, outlooks, and ideas that enrich the training of its student body and better equip its graduates to render with understanding their vital service to humanity." Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 314 (1978) (Powell, J.). Of substantially greater controversy is whether considering racial/ethnic background in arriving at a diverse student body is permissible. For those minority groups that continue to face the effects of persistent and long-term discrimination, consideration of race or ethnicity is plainly necessary to achieve the kind of diversity the nation's best schools seek. 

If a university sought to include the outlooks and ideas of those raised in poverty, it would not be expected to obtain that particular diversity by considering the health condition of applicants. Such an approach would be an unsatisfactory substitute for direct consideration of socio-economic status, even though there is assuredly some empirical correlation and some rational explanatory connection between poverty and health. The approach is unsatisfactory because poor health is not restricted to the poor, because many relatively poor children are nonetheless very healthy, and because health status measures only one element of the experience of being poor. Capturing the entirety of the experience requires directly considering income and wealth because they shape directly and multifariously the "experiences, outlooks, and ideas" of the students in question. 

Race and ethnicity are similarly indicative of an agglomeration of experiences for which no proxy can adequately substitute. Because certain minority groups have an experience shaped by identification as different and formed by society's reactions to that perceived difference, only consideration of that racial/ethnic difference  [*5]  could possibly capture the desired diversity. The Latino community--identified consistently from its forcible introduction to this nation as significantly distinct from the white majority--is one community whose members' experiences are profoundly influenced by race or ethnicity. While this shaping experience does not result in unanimity of opinion on any issue, it nonetheless influences personal development in a way different from and more complete than any other characteristic empirically or rationally connected to minority status. 

Nothing in the Constitution requires state educational institutions to refrain from capturing this particular diversity as directly as universities seek to capture the perspectives of a range of socioeconomic statuses. The Constitution proscribes racial discrimination; it does not require the state to be willfully blind to the simple realities of American society. One of these realities is that racial/ethnic identity continues to shape the experiences of Latinos and other racial minorities. 

A. The Latino Community Has Historically and Continuously Been Seen as Different from the Majority White Community. 

Having recently become the nation's largest minority group, n2 Latinos may appear to some observers to be a group of relative newcomers to this nation--largely indistinguishable from previous waves of immigrants from  [*6]  various parts of Europe--which has achieved its demographic and social significance solely as a result of voluntary decisions to migrate to the United States. This perniciously ahistorical view has a policy corollary, holding that Latinos should be treated no differently than those previous European immigrant groups and should be expected to overcome presumptively momentary spasms of anti-Latino sentiment without particular government assistance, and, in particular, without affirmative action. In addition, this understanding of Latinos implicitly characterizes them as devoid of any unique viewpoint, such as would be shaped by experiences appreciably different from other "immigrant ethnic groups." 

n2 The Census Bureau estimates that, as of July 2001, 37 million Latinos lived in the United States, comprising 13 percent of the population, and surpassing African Americans to become the largest minority group. 

In all respects, this impression of the Latino experience ignores the group's unique history and its experience of longstanding and continuous racial distinction and discrimination. The nation's two largest Latino subgroups share an experience that only two other racial minority groups claim--namely the forcible and involuntary introduction of the group to United States residency. n3 While the ranks of those forcibly introduced have been swelled by numerous subsequent immigrants, these newcomers join communities long viewed as non-white and subjected to discrimination on the basis of their difference. n4 Moreover,  [*7]  immigrants from Latin America migrate to a nation whose political and economic interventions have more or less profoundly shaped the experience in their home countries. n5 

n3 African Americans, introduced to this country as enslaved servants, and Native Americans, subjected to repeated conquest and genocide, have the most compelling histories of forcible introduction to the United States. All three groups--African Americans, Native Americans, Latinos--whose history lies in forcible introduction to the United States are also those facing the most severe underrepresentation in higher education. 

n4 As the federal government's categorization of Latinos has developed, the group does include some European immigrants. The experience of Spanish and Portuguese Americans--who together comprise only a small percentage of the nation's Latino population--may more closely track that of other European immigrant groups. Of course, their experience also differs, if only because, by language and cultural affinity, they often settle in areas of large non-European Latino population, and they are often seen by non-Latino society as indistinguishable. 

n5 See generally Walter LaFeber, Inevitable Revolutions, The United States in Central America (1993) (U.S. role in Central America and immigration as result of conflict in region); Mexican and Central American Population and U.S. Immigration Policy (Frank Bean, Jurgen Schmandt, and Sidney Weintraub eds., 1989) (examining effect of U.S. policy on immigration from Mexico and Central America). 

Latinos, whether immigrant or native-born, have long been subject to discrimination in this country, stretching back to at least the mid-nineteenth century. A half century ago, in the same term as Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954)--generally acknowledged as the start of the modern civil rights era--Latinos celebrated their own victory in Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U.S. 475 (1954), the first Supreme Court holding that Latinos are a separate group for purposes of civil rights protections. Of course, this landmark Court decision merely acknowledged social reality for Latinos, who were treated as a different and second-class group wherever they lived in significant numbers. This discrimination continued despite the Hernandez decision, and the courts have had to intervene on numerous occasions to bring relief from anti-Latino discrimination. 

This historical and continuing reality has forged a community with a unique, albeit variegated, experience influenced heavily by identity as Latino; most Latinos  [*8]  bring a viewpoint to issues informed in significant part by the distinction of being Latino in the United States. Meanwhile, society at large continues to draw this distinction as well, too often using the ability to distinguish members of the group--by name, appearance, language--to engage in anti-Latino discrimination. Remedying that discrimination and including that uniquely-shaped experience both present strong reasons for the preservation of affirmative action in higher education. 

1. The Two Largest Latino Subgroups Were Forcibly Introduced to the United States. 

At least since President James Monroe's promulgation of his eponymous Doctrine in 1823, the United States has claimed a special dominion over the nations and people of Latin America. Sometimes benignly protective, other times exploitative, and most of the time a varying admixture of the two, this claimed dominion has long established a unique relationship between the United States and Latin America. Of course, this dominion has twice resulted in war and the United States' incorporation of large areas of previously Latin American territory--as well as significant numbers of inhabitants of incorporated territory. Thus, the United States-Mexico War resulted in 1848 in this country's incorporation of most of what is now the southwestern United States. Similarly, at the conclusion of the Spanish-American War, in which the Marines invaded Puerto Rico, the 1898 Treaty of Paris ceded Puerto Rico to the United States. After experiencing increasing autonomy under Spain just before the war, Puerto Rico instead became a U.S. colony and today continues under a unique commonwealth status. 

Discussion and acknowledgment of the non-white status of the incorporated inhabitants surrounded these  [*9]  military actions, which resulted in introducing the first large numbers of what are today the two largest Latino groups, Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans. n6 Thus, for example, former Vice President John Calhoun argued on the floor of the Senate in 1848 that, "to incorporate Mexico, would be the very first instance of the kind of incorporating an Indian race; for more than half of the Mexicans are Indians, and the other is composed chiefly of mixed tribes." n7 One early twentieth century academic pointedly concluded that, "not Latins but Indians dwell south of the Rio Grande." Ernest Gruening, Mexico and Its Heritage 69 (1928). Given the nation's then-prevalent views toward non-whites in general, and Indians in particular, there can be little doubt that Calhoun's statement and sentiment, and others similar, had an effect on the reputation and treatment of Mexicans in the United States. As one early historian and observer of the Latino community in the United States stated, "Mexicans were consistently  [*10]  equated with Indians by the race-conscious Anglo-Americans." Carey McWilliams, North From Mexico 209 (1948). 

n6 The 2000 Census shows that Mexican Americans make up over 58 percent of the national Latino population, while Puerto Ricans make up another 10 percent. 2000 Census, SFI PCT 11. 

n7 Cong. Globe, 30th Cong., 1st Sess. (1848) (Statement of Sen. Calhoun). Calhoun was not alone in focusing on race; war proponents used arguments about the backwardness of non-whites to justify aggression, while opponents voiced concerns about absorbing Mexico's large non-white population. See Frederick Merk, Manifest Destiny and Mission in American History 157-66 (1963); Reginald Horsman, Race and Manifest Destiny 231 (1981) ("Mexicans had been repeatedly attacked in the United States as a degenerate, largely Indian race unable to control or improve the territories they owned"); Gary A. Greenfield & Don B. Kates, Mexican Americans, Racial Discrimination and the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 63 Cal. L. Rev. 662 (1975) (examining several areas to conclude that Mexican Americans have been perceived as non-white). 

2. The Legal System Viewed Latinos as Distinct From Whites. 

The United States legal system also recognized Latinos as distinct from the white community. For example, dissenting from the notorious holding in Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857), two justices of this Court cited the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo as proof that the nation had previously exercised the power to accord citizenship to non-whites. Thus, Justice John McLean stated that "under the late treaty with Mexico, we have made citizens of all grades, combinations and colors." 60 U.S. (19 How.) at 533 (McLean, J., dissenting). Justice Benjamin Curtis cited the treaty with Mexico, as well as treaties with Choctaw and Cherokee tribes, in arguing that "by solemn treaties, large bodies of Mexican and North American Indians . . . have been admitted to citizenship." 60 U.S. (19 How.) at 586, 587 (Curtis, J., dissenting). This Court discussion was virtually contemporaneous with introduction of Mexican Americans to the country. n8 

n8 Late in the nineteenth century, a Texas federal court permitted a Mexican American to naturalize, but only after noting that he might be "debarred by the strict letter of the law" providing for citizenship of whites only. In re Rodriguez, 81 F. 349 (W.D. Tex. 1897). One historian has explained that the case arose as part of an attempt at wholesale disenfranchisement of Latinos in San Antonio. Arnoldo De Leon, The Tejano Community, 1836-1900, at 33 (1982). 

Nonetheless, by the time of the landmark case of Hernandez v. Texas, both parties and Court seemed to  [*11]  assume that Mexican Americans were legally considered simply a subgroup of "whites." In fact, this case and its antecedents are the exception that proves the rule. Before this Court's decision in Norris v. Alabama, 294 U.S. 587 (1935), adopting the "exclusion rule" permitting African Americans to offer evidence of longtime exclusion from juries as prima facie proof of discrimination, the state courts in Texas routinely excluded both African Americans and Mexican Americans on the basis of race. n9 Only after Norris did the state determine that Mexican Americans should be classified as "white"; this permitted Texas to argue that Norris did not apply to Mexican Americans, and that they continued to bear the burden of proving discrimination directly. For example, the state court in Hernandez held that, since the all-white grand and petit jury were "composed of members of his race, it cannot be said, in the absence of proof of actual discrimination, that appellant has been discriminated against. . . ." Hernandez v. State, 251 S.W.2d 531, 536 (Tex. Crim. App. 1952). Thus, the fact that the first major case involving Latinos to reach the Supreme Court implicitly considered them "white" emanated directly from state attempts to continue to discriminate against Latinos despite strengthened civil rights protections. n10 

n9 Thus, for example, Carrasco v. State, 95 S.W.2d 433 (Tex. Crim. App. 1936), involved a motion to set aside an indictment on grounds of "discrimination against the Mexican race on the part of the jury commission." Id. at 434-35. Although no Mexican American had been summoned to grand jury service in the preceding four years, the court found no violation because there was no direct evidence to show that "Mexicans were excluded or discriminated against solely because of race." Id. at 434. 

n10 Indeed, the irony of the Hernandez case is best epitomized by the Jackson County clerk's testimony at trial that "I think we all understand that the Latin Americans are considered as white," delivered in a courthouse with two men's toilets, "one unmarked and one marked 'Colored Men' and 'Hombres Aqui' (Men Here)." Transcript of Record at 28, Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U.S. 475 (No. 406); Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U.S. at 479-80. 

 [*12]  In other cases, Latinos were considered "white" for reasons similarly related to continued formal discrimination. Thus, for example, in Mendez v. Westminster School District, 64 F. Supp. 544 (S.D. Cal. 1946), aff'd, 161 F.2d 774 (9th Cir. 1947), in which the Ninth Circuit outlawed segregation of Mexican Americans in certain California school districts, the parties stipulated that Mexican Americans were part of the white race. See Mendez, 64 F. Supp. at 546. The plaintiffs likely sought the stipulation to avoid court precedent that, at the time, still permitted segregation between races under the "separate but equal" doctrine, and to avoid a California statute that permitted districts to establish "separate schools for Indian children, excepting children of Indians who are wards of the United States Government and children of all other Indians who are descendants of the original American Indians of the United States." Cal. Educ. Code § 8003 (repealed 1947). This statute would permit segregation of children descended from the Indians of Mexico; thus, plaintiffs' stipulation avoided a law directed toward segregation of Mexican Americans. n11 

n11 The reason that the districts agreed to the stipulation might lie in their argument, redolent of Texas in the jury exclusion context, seeking to establish that intra-racial discrimination was more acceptable than inter-racial discrimination: "If it be fallacious argument to contend that the [African] race is stamped with a badge of inferiority by separation, how can it be contended that one group of white persons are [so] stamped . . . simply because they are separated from other groups of white people in the public schools?" Appellant's Reply Br. to ACLU at 3, Mendez (No. 11310). 

 [*13]  In sum, the legal system, like United States society, has traditionally viewed Latinos as non-white--different from whites of any European ethnicity. n12 The ultimate formal classification of Mexican Americans, the largest Latino subgroup, as "white" stems more from attempts to perpetuate entrenched discrimination against them in the face of increased court hostility toward inter-racial discrimination, than from any genuine affirmation of similarity between Latinos and white descendants of European immigrants. 

n12 While the above discussion focuses on Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, the second largest Latino subgroup, have faced consistent treatment as non-white. As one court has noted, "it must be acknowledged that Hispanics of Puerto Rican descent are not perceived to be 'white' by many Americans, regardless of their skin color." Garcia v. Gardner's Nurseries, Inc., 585 F. Supp. 369, 375 (D. Conn. 1984). "Whatever else it may be, Puerto Rico is not a society that is preponderantly 'white' under conventional North American definitions of 'race.'" Jose A. Cabranes, Citizenship and the American Empire 98 n.475 (1975), quoted in Garcia, 585 F. Supp. at 375 n.3. 

3. The U.S. Census Has Long Recognized the Latino Community As Distinct From Other Racial Groups. 

Further evidence of the Latino community's distinct identity and of society's longstanding treatment of the group as different from the white community lies in the Census Bureau's meandering efforts to arrive at an acceptable separate categorization of the group. In 1930, the Census listed a "Mexican" race category for the first time, instructing enumerators to use it "for all persons born in Mexico, or having parents born in Mexico, who are not definitely white, Negro, Indian, Chinese, or Japanese." Bureau of the Census, Fifteenth Census of the United  [*14]  States, Population Bulletin, Second Series, U.S. Summary 7 (1931). This category was eliminated in 1940 when the instructions were that "Mexicans are to be regarded as white unless definitely of Indian or other nonwhite race." Bureau of the Census, Sixteenth Census of the United States, Population, Part I 296 (1943). This temporary classification as presumptively "white" was more likely the result of political pressure than indicative of any dramatic change in societal perception of Latinos. n13 Indeed, the Census Bureau eventually arrived at a means of recognizing the distinct Latino community while not selecting a single racial category. n14 Thus, in 1970 and in the succeeding three censuses, the Bureau has used a Hispanic-origin question separate from race. 

n13 "The 1930 census definition of Mexicans evoked 'unfavorable reactions' from the Mexican government and the U.S. Department of State." Leo Grebler, Joan C. Moore & Ralph C. Guzman, The Mexican People 601 (1970). 

n14 Of course, the use of a separate non-racial category also recognizes the fact that the Latino community includes many persons who identify as Latino, but also as black, white, or Native American. 

The actions of Latinos filling out the census further echo this historical--70 years and counting--and continuing official recognition of the Latino community as distinct from others. In the most recent two censuses, the over-whelming majority of all persons who identified their race as "other" have been Latino. n15 Thus, the Census has consistently recognized the Latino community as distinct, and has provided the opportunity for Latinos themselves  [*15]  to identify as separate from whites, blacks, or Asians--an opportunity taken by huge numbers. 

n15 In 1990, over 9.5 million Latinos identified their race as "other"; they made up over 97 percent of those selecting "other" race. 1990 Census, STF1 P010. In 2000, nearly 15 million Latinos selected "other" race, making up over 96 percent of all persons who chose that classification. 2000 Census, SF1 P8. 

4. Voting Shows a Distinct Latino Community. 

The distinctness of the Latino community also appears strongly in the area of voting. In its 1975 expansion of the Voting Rights Act to reach language minorities, Congress expressly recognized that the Latino community has been the target of efforts to isolate it and to diminish its political power. Congress concluded that "language minority citizens, like blacks throughout the South, must overcome the effects of discrimination as well as efforts to minimize the impact of their political participation." S. Rep. No. 94-295, at 25 (1975). Congress defined "language minority citizens" as "persons who are Asian American, American Indian, Alaskan Natives, or Spanish heritage." Id. at 24. The Senate Judiciary Committee stated that, among language minorities, "persons of Spanish heritage was the group most severely affected by discriminatory practices," and expressly noted that "no evidence was received concerning the voting difficulties of other language groups," such as German, Italian, French, Polish, and Russian. Id. at 31. 

It is not surprising, in light of these efforts to distinguish and discriminate against Latino voters, that they would vote cohesively as a group, and often against the desires and choices of white voters. In the 1990s, for example, California, where over 11 million Latinos now reside, held elections on three highly controversial initiatives, each showing strong polarization between Latinos and the majority white electorate. In 1994, Proposition 187, a proposal to restrict the rights of immigrants, received the support of 63 percent of white voters, while an astounding 77 percent of Latino electors cast a "No" vote.  [*16]  Los Angeles Times Poll--California Exit Poll, Nov. 8, 1994. Two years later, Proposition 209, which restricted the use of affirmative action, garnered the support of 63 percent of white voters, while 76 percent of Latinos voted "No." Los Angeles Times Poll--General Election Exit Poll, Nov. 5, 1996. In 1998, white voters gave Proposition 227, which severely restricted bilingual education, 67 percent support, but Latinos voted "No" by a near mirror-image 63 percent. Los Angeles Times Poll--California Primary Election, June 2, 1998. Latinos have responded to their being treated as distinct and being subjected to discrimination by taking on a distinct identity in their voting habits. 

5. Society Perceives Latinos as Distinct. 

Media treatment of Latinos is central to societal views because it reflects commonly-held opinions, and also reinforces them as society consumes its stories and images. Unfortunately, the entertainment media has responded to Latinos with discriminatory and systematic exclusion, punctuated occasionally by mostly negative and limited portrayals of Latino characters. See Louis DeSipio, Lisa Navarette & Charles Kamasaki, Out of the Picture: Hispanics in the Media 2-3, 22 (1994) (Latinos have an "overwhelmingly negative stereotypical media image"); McCrae A. Parker, et al., Fall Colors 2001-02 Prime Time Diversity Report 3, 22 (2002) ("criminal" among likeliest Latino occupations). Representing merely two percent of primetime characters, Latinos are the most underrepresented group on television as compared to national population. Id. at 14. Moreover, the country's media capital, Los Angeles, has a population that is 47 percent Latino, and the country's second major media center, New York, also has a large Latino population, 27 percent. 2000 Census PL94-171 P2. Not coincidentally, these cities are the fictional settings for large  [*17]  numbers of television shows and movies. It is in this real-word context, brimming with Latinos, that the media's exclusion of Latinos takes place. This exclusion can hardly be accidental as the entertainment industry has presented fabricated social interactions, purportedly taking place in Los Angeles or New York, yet bereft of Latinos. See Harry P. Pachon, et al., Missing in Action: Latinos In and Out of Hollywood 12 (1999). When Latinos are represented, the industry portrays them in cameo roles with negative implications, such as drug dealers, gang members, or unruly students. Id.; Louis DeSipio, Talking Back to Television: Latinos Discuss How Television Portrays Them and the Quality of Programming Options 8-9 (1998). Moreover, in media advertising, corporations similarly behave based on demeaning and damaging stereotypes against Latinos. See, e.g., Civil Rights Forum, When Being Number One Is Not Enough: The Impact of Advertising Practices On Minority-Owned & Minority-Formatted Broadcast Stations 12 (1999) (radio advertisers "desire to disassociate a company's image" from Latino consumers). While non-Latinos are influenced by this exclusion and negative portrayal, Latinos also view these images--with a unique perspective as the ignored group. Id. This exclusion from the highly influential media forms a key part of the experience of Latinos in the United States. 

Social scientists have confirmed what turning on the television would suggest--whites notice and treat Latinos as distinct. Non-Latinos continue to associate negative stereotypes with Latinos, such as being more violent, more criminal, dirtier, less intelligent, and less hard-working. Tom W. Smith, Intergroup Relations in a Diverse America 38 (2001); Linda A. Jackson, Stereotypes, Emotion, Behaviors, and Overall Attitudes Toward Hispanics by Anglos (1995). Similarly, non-Latinos grossly overestimate the  [*18]  percentage of Latinos who live in poverty, who receive welfare, and who immigrated illegally. Michael A. Fletcher, Latinos See Bias in Elgin's Fight Against Blight; Tensions Rise Over Crackdown on Crowded Housing, Washington Post, May 29, 2000 (excerpting poll results). In fact, non-Latinos are so cognizant of the presence and distinct identity of Latinos that non-Latinos can remember the nature and quality of their lifetime social contacts with Latinos. Smith, supra, at 12-13; Jackson, supra. 

Given their continued experience of disparate treatment, Latinos unsurprisingly also view themselves as distinct. The majority of Latinos would "prefer to identify their race as 'Latino' or 'Hispanic'" to distinguish themselves from whites, African Americans, and Asian Americans. Kaiser Family Foundation, Pew Hispanic Center, 2002 National Survey of Latinos 23 (2002). Latinos also identify racial prejudice as the "most important" issue facing their group. The Latino Coalition, 2001 Latino Poll (2001). In addition, as a group, Latinos strongly depart from many views held by the rest of society. For example, Latinos have more positive attitudes towards immigration and language rights as compared to non-Latinos, and less positive perceptions of fairness in law enforcement. Smith, supra, at 15-16; Yuen J. Huo and Tom Tyler, How Different Ethnic Groups React to Legal Authority 30 (2000). All of society--Latinos and non-Latinos--consistently views Latinos as a separate group. 

 [*19]  B. Because of Group Identity, Latino Lawyers are More Likely to Serve the Latino Population. 

Latinos, like all Americans, face important legal issues requiring counsel. Yet, Latinos often lack access to legal counsel. n16 There are surely many reasons, but among the most obvious is economics; fee rates price attorneys far beyond the resources of much of the Latino population. Thus, lawyers who choose to serve Latinos must be willing to make economic sacrifices. Due to cultural affinity among Latinos, driven in part by a shared history of discrimination, Latino lawyers are more likely to make these sacrifices and work among Latino clients. Richard O. Lempert, David L. Chambers, & Terry K. Adams, Michigan's Minority Graduates in Practice: The River Runs Through Law School, 25 Law & Soc. Inquiry 395, 401 (2000). Yet, even in an era of affirmative action, Latino lawyers are in extremely short supply. See Miguel A. Mendez & Leo P. Martinez, Toward A Statistical Profile of Latina/os in the Legal Profession, 13 Berkeley La Raza L.J. 59, 65 (2002) (Latinos were 9 percent of national population in 1990, but only 2.49 percent of lawyers). Even if these two facts--few Latino lawyers and few lawyers for Latino clients--could not be definitively linked, it seems fair to assume that Latino clients would suffer the most damage from a further decrease in the number of Latino lawyers. 

n16 In California, Latinos are three times more likely than whites to be severely underserved by the legal profession. California Commission on Access to Justice, The Path to Equal Justice in California, 3-9 (2002) (defining income levels of underserved); 2000 Census SF 3 P87, P159H, P1591 (establishing ethnic proportions for those income levels in California). 

 [*20]  C. The Latino Community Shares Common Characteristics of Value to Law School Diversity. 

Underlying the treatment of Latinos as a distinct group is the undeniable truth that the community shares many characteristics that make it identifiable and separate. Treatment as different over the many years of Latino presence in this country has in turn served to reinforce further some of these identifiable traits and experiences. Many of the most important of these Latino characteristics are catalogued in the Latino Organizations' amici curiae brief, filed by Munger, Tolles & Olson and the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund (PRLDEF) in Gratz v. Bollinger. We will not repeat that discussion here. Of course, the value of including Latinos with these experiences in the law school setting is as high as it is in the undergraduate context. 

For example, the Latino Organizations' Gratz brief points out that most Latino extended families include members who are bilingual or monolingual Spanish-speaking. Exposure to this language-minority experience has obvious application to legal issues. This Court has dealt with language issues in many contexts, such as education, see Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563 (1974); jury exclusion, see Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991); and government services, see Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43 (1997). Federal and state appellate courts have addressed language in other contexts, such as employment, see Garcia v. Spun Steak Co., 998 F.2d 1480 (9th Cir. 1993); Garcia v. Gloor, 618 F.2d 264 (5th Cir. 1980); immigration, see El Rescate Legal Servs. v. Executive Office of Immig. Review, 959 F.2d 742 (9th Cir. 1991); and consumer protection, see Ramirez v. Plough, Inc., 25 Cal. Rptr. 2d 97 (Cal. 1993). Language  [*21]  arises in a broad array of legal contexts; students acquainted with the experience of language minorities could provide valuable insight. 

Similarly, Latino extended families frequently include persons of varying immigration statuses. As the Latino Organizations' Gratz brief explains, immigration issues implicate numerous areas of academic endeavor. Law is plainly one of the most prominent of these areas because immigration itself is so heavily regulated. A short seven years ago, two congressional acts dramatically overhauled our immigration regulatory scheme. See Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-193, 110 Stat. 2105 (1996); Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996). The ink on court precedent interpreting these laws has only begun to dry, yet new legislation to address security concerns has already been enacted. As questions of the proper balance between security and privacy rights percolate through the courts, it is evident that immigration will form a central part of any law school curriculum in the next decade. The presence of Latinos familiar with the human side of these issues could greatly enhance classroom discussion. 

With respect to other Latino common characteristics discussed in the Latino Organizations' Gratz brief, the nexus with law school discussion is also apparent. As a quintessential element of daily human interaction, employment issues, as well as concerns of wealth distribution and poverty, will always form a central element of legal discourse. From Brown to these very Michigan cases, the importance of education--and related equity concerns--is manifest in this Court's own docket. 

 [*22]  Yet, the most important common Latino characteristic is exposure to racial discrimination. The Latino Organizations' Gratz brief catalogues the breadth of this community experience, reinforcing the description above of the historical and continuing treatment of Latinos as distinct from the white majority. Latinos have been subjected to consistent disparate treatment as a part of their being thus singled out. It is this particular Latino experience that would most be missed if Latinos are excluded from law schools. As explained above, it is also this experience that is at greatest risk if reasonable race-consciousness is no longer permitted in admissions. Abandoning this longstanding approach threatens to further isolate and distinguish the Latino community by excluding it from prestigious institutions of higher education. This greater isolation of a growing minority community is, in turn, the surest road to societal instability. 
  
II. PUBLIC EDUCATION BEARS A SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY TO ERADICATE SOCIETAL DISCRIMINATION. 

Among the most frequently excerpted portions of this Court's unanimous opinion in Brown v. Board of Education is the paragraph explaining why "today, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments." 347 U.S. at 493. Chief Justice Earl Warren's eloquent description of education as critical both to the individual and to the community finds many comrades in Court annals. "This theme, expressing an abiding respect for the vital role of education in a free society, may be found in numerous opinions of Justices of this Court written both before and after Brown was decided." San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 30  [*23]  (1973) (citing cases). Education plays a vital role in "'inculcating fundamental values necessary to the maintenance of a democratic political system'" as well as in "providing the basic tools by which individuals might lead economically productive lives to the benefit of us all." Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 221 (1982) (quoting Ambach v. Norwick, 411 U.S. 68, 77 (1976)). 

Education's "fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of our society," id., embraces both a capability and an obligation to address fundamental social issues, with respect to both the individual and the community. Thus, societal discrimination bears an intimate relation to public education. State-operated education bears an undeniable responsibility for the continued existence of such discrimination, which reflects, at minimum, a failure to inculcate successfully one of our nation's central ideals--equal treatment regardless of race--and likely also reflects the perpetuation of pernicious values favoring discrimination during the era when racial oppression was rampant. At the same time, state-run educational institutions are peculiarly well-situated to take steps to eliminate societal discrimination and to promote the equality that would obtain in its absence. A necessary corollary of these principles is that a state-run university's interest in achieving student diversity and in remedying discrimination are closely-related. 

The inculcation of fundamental community values, such as values of non-discrimination, is a long-term endeavor, and a state, like Michigan, that provides public education from kindergarten through doctorate, must view it as a continuing enterprise at all levels. As post-secondary education becomes more and more a universal experience, a state could not cease its teaching of civic values at the twelfth grade without surely failing in its  [*24]  vital role. Moreover, the teaching of anti-discrimination values necessarily requires the presence of persons, such as Latinos, who have been and remain the frequent targets of societal discrimination. Through academic discourse and extracurricular experience, the presence of such diversity--racial diversity--plays a critical role in fulfilling education's fundamental mission of "transmitting 'the values on which our society rests.'" Plyler, 457 U.S. at 221 (quoting Ambach, 411 U.S. at 77). This, in turn, will assist the state to eliminate, in the future, societal discrimination inside and outside of academe. 

From the perspective of the individual, a Latino could fairly conclude--again because of the implicit failure in a primary educational mission--that state educational institutions are largely to blame for any societal discrimination affecting her family and herself. By recognizing this responsibility and by ensuring that the effects of discrimination are muted, if not eliminated, in student admissions, public institutions of higher education take an important step toward redressing discrimination and toward ensuring its full demise in the future. Failure to take this step misses a critical opportunity. As this Court has stated, "by depriving the children of any disfavored group of an education, we foreclose the means by which that group might raise the level of esteem in which it is held by the majority." Plyler, 457 U.S. at 222. This conclusion applies with equal vigor to higher education today. By increasing minority access to the most-esteemed professions, the state strikes a strong blow for the future elimination of societal discrimination. 

This Court's consistent recognition of the crucial role of public education in maintaining and transmitting community values, and in equipping individuals to contribute to society, epitomizes an obligation to eradicate  [*25]  discrimination--whether or not it can be traced more or less sharply to a particular institution. Societal discrimination stems directly from failures of the state-run educational system. As a result, public educational institutions bear a special responsibility and capability to foster a society that rejects all remnants of racial discrimination against minorities. They must be free to fulfill their responsibility and to channel their capability toward that noble end. 
  
III. MICHIGAN LAW SCHOOL CONTINUES TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST LATINO APPLICANTS. 

The Michigan Law School has an even more specific responsibility to remedy discrimination. To this day, the Law School continues to subject applicants to discriminatory criteria. In its admissions process, the "Law School evaluates a composite of the applicant's Law School Admissions Test and undergraduate grade-point average." Grutter v. Bollinger, 288 F.3d 732, 736 (6th Cir. 2002). This emphasis on "numbers" might superficially appear to be innocuous, but the Law School's LSAT and grade point average (GPA) criteria both have a debilitating effect on Latino applicants. Discriminatory outcomes based on these two criteria have been the subject of rigorous academic and empirical analysis. The discriminatory effect of the LSAT against Latinos is well-documented. See, e.g., Daria Roithmayr, Barriers to Entry: A Market Lock-In Model of Discrimination 86 Va. L. Rev. 727, 762 (2000); William C. Kidder, Note, Does the LSAT Mirror or Magnify Racial and Ethnic Differences in Educational Attainment?: A Study of Equally Achieving "Elite" College Students, 89 Cal. L. Rev. 1055, 1073-74 (2001). Similarly, Latinos are disadvantaged by formulaic evaluations of GPAs because there is a gap between the GPAs of Latinos as compared to  [*26]  whites. See id. at 1097-98. Therefore, through its use of LSAT scores and GPA, the Law School systemically downgrades Latino applicants across two different criteria. 

Yet, despite their discriminatory effect, GPA and LSAT scores are the linchpin of the admissions process. The Law School creates both a composite and an index based solely on the results of these two criteria. "This composite can be visualized as a grid with standardized test scores on the horizontal axis and grade-point average on the vertical axis. . . . Constructed in this manner, the highest combination of test score and undergraduate grade-point averages are found in the grid's upper right-hand corner." Grutter v. Bollinger, 137 F. Supp. 2d 821, 826. 

The Law School's policy is clear: "Bluntly, the higher one's index score, the greater should be one's chances of being admitted. The lower the score, the greater the risk the candidate poses." Id. (quoting the Law School's admissions policy). True to the Law School's word, in this grid or composite, an applicant's probability of being admitted increases substantially as the applicant moves toward the grid's upper right hand corner. Id. While it is true that a high composite score will not guarantee admission, id., a low score will virtually guarantee rejection. "Of the 966 offers of admission made in 1991, 843 (87%) were made to applicants who fell within the nine cells closest to [the top right-hand] corner." Id. 

Although the LSAT and GPA form the basis of most admissions decisions, the Law School reviews every individual application and considers "soft variables" like enthusiasm of recommenders, quality of undergraduate institution, quality of the applicant's essay, residency, leadership, and work experience, unique talents or interests, and areas and difficulty of undergraduate course selection. Grutter, 288 F.3d at 736. Nevertheless, the Law  [*27]  School has defined only two limited circumstances where the "soft variables," combined with other factors might sometimes outweigh a relatively low composite score. Id. Only one of these involves considering race, as one of many elements in achieving diversity. Thus, despite their discriminatory effect, "numbers" largely drive the Law School's admissions process. 

In addition, some of the "soft variables" that the Law School considers further amplify the discriminatory effect of the LSAT and GPA. For example, Latinos often attend less prestigious universities or begin their careers in community colleges. Consequently, regardless of academic performance, Latinos may be further handicapped by the Law School's emphasis on automatically rewarding students who attended prestigious undergraduate universities. 

Given its interest in maintaining a diverse student body, the Law School has a long history of recognizing and debating the discriminatory effect of its admissions policies. As early as 1970, the dean recognized that Law School admissions criteria had a discriminatory effect on minorities and attempted to control for this effect by admitting significant numbers of underrepresented minorities. Grutter, 137 F. Supp. 2d at 830 n.8. Similarly, throughout the 1980s, the Law School faculty debated the extent to which the Law School should mitigate the discriminatory effect of the admissions policy in order to admit significant numbers of minorities. 

Therefore, in 1992, when the Law School adopted its current admissions policy, it is a virtual certainty that officials completely understood the magnitude of the discriminatory effect that they chose to impose on Latino applicants. Three directors of admissions, covering 1979 to 1999, understood that the Law School's admissions policies  [*28]  worked to exclude Latino applicants from being admitted. Allan Stillwagon, director of admissions from 1979 to 1990, testified that, given its criteria, the Law School had to consider race because otherwise very few minority applicants would have been admitted. Id. at 831. Similarly, Dennis Shields, the Law School's director of admissions from 1991 to 1998, and his successor, Erica Munzel, explicitly acknowledged the discriminatory impact of LSAT scores and undergraduate GPAs. Id. at 838. Both testified that in order to achieve a diverse student body, the Law School controlled for the LSAT's and GPA's discriminatory impact. Id. 

Thus, knowledgeable admissions officers recognized the extent to which the Law School's discriminatory factors would cripple Latino applicants absent affirmative action. The federal circuit court agreed, concluding that "eliminating race as a factor in the admissions process would dramatically lower minority admissions." Grutter, 288 F.3d at 737. Without affirmative action, Latinos, African Americans, and Native Americans would have constituted merely four percent of the Law School's entering class in 2001, according to the Law School's statistical expert. Id. Dean Jeffrey Lehman, the dean of the Law School from 1994 to the present, concurred that the Law School's own discriminatory criteria might reduce underrepresented minorities to "token" levels if race were eliminated as a factor. Id. at 738. 

Without the mitigating effect of affirmative action, Latino representation at the law school would be devastated--to the point of virtual exclusion. Latinos would represent perhaps two percent of the total class. Id. This minuscule number reflects the magnitude of the Law School's discriminatory admissions criteria. Moreover,  [*29]  these dismal admission rates for Latinos, absent affirmative action, would undoubtedly create a prima facie violation under regulations implementing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 34 C.F.R. § 100.3(b)(2). 

Finally, the Law School has imposed criteria which have poor predictive ability, in contrast to their demonstrable discriminatory effect. Neither the LSAT nor GPA accurately predict success in law school, nor do they predict success beyond law school. Lani Guinier, An Empirical Study Confirmative Action, 25 Law & Soc. Inquiry 565, 569-71, 573 (2000). In the end, the Law School's actions in mitigating against these discriminatory factors speaks volumes. The Law School implicitly recognizes that its admissions policies simultaneously discriminate against Latinos while failing to identify the best students or future lawyers. In this context, affirmative action is imperative. Scores of Latinos were admitted to the Law School as a result of affirmative action and proved to be just as able and qualified as their classmates in the Law School classroom and in the profession. 

CONCLUSION 

Viewpoints formed through the experience of discrimination--in any of its multiple facets--on the basis of race, can only be captured through reasonable consideration of race. Members of the Latino community share this experience. Public educational institutions bear a responsibility to reflect these viewpoints in their student bodies for three reasons--to enhance diversity; to take strong steps to eradicate societal discrimination; and to adjust for the continued use of discriminatory admissions criteria. Affirmative action must be preserved for the sake of  [*30]  Latino students and for the sake of this nation's prosperous future. The Court should affirm the Sixth Circuit's decision in favor of Michigan Law School.
