**quanteda** has functionality to select, remove or compound for multi-word expressions such as phrasal verbs ('try on', 'wake up' etc.) and place names ("New York", "South Korea" etc.). 

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(quanteda)
```

# Tokenize

```{r}
toks <- tokens(data_corpus_inaugural)
```

# Define multi-word expressions

Functions for tokens objects take a character vector, a dictionary or collocations as `pattern`. All those three can be used for multi-word expressions, but you have to be aware their differences.

## Character vector

The most basic way to define multi-word expressions is separating words by whitespaces and wrap the character vector by `phrase()`.

```{r}
multiword <- c('United States', 'New York')
```

### Keyword-in-context

`kwic()` is useful to find multi-word expressions in tokens. If you are not sure if 'United' and 'States' are separated, check their positions (e.g. '434:435').

```{r}
head(kwic(toks, phrase(multiword)))
```

### Select tokens

Similarly, you can select or remove multi-word expression using `tokens_select()`.

```{r}
head(tokens_select(toks, phrase(multiword)))
```

### Compound tokens

`tokens_compound()` joins elements of multi-word expressions by underscore, so they become 'United_States' and 'New_York'.

```{r}
comp_toks <- tokens_compound(toks, phrase(multiword))
head(tokens_select(comp_toks, c('United_States', 'New_York')))
```

## Dictionary

Elements of multi-word expressions should be separately by whitespaces in a dictionary, but you do use `phrase()` here.

```{r}
multiword_dict <- dictionary(list(country = 'United States', 
                             city = 'New York'))
```

### Lookup dictionary

```{r}
head(tokens_lookup(toks, multiword_dict))
```

## Collocations

If you use `textstat_collocations()`, you can discover multi-word expressions. 

### Discover collocations

If `textstat_collocations()` is applied to a tokens object comprised only of capitalize words, it usually returns multi-word proper names.

```{r}
col <- toks %>% 
       tokens_remove(stopwords()) %>% 
       tokens_select('^[A-Z]', valuetype = 'regex', case_insensitive = FALSE, padding = TRUE) %>% 
       textstat_collocations(min_count = 5, tolower = FALSE)
head(col)
```

### Compound collocations

Collocations are automatically recognized as multi-word expressions by `tokens_compound()` in *case-sensitive fixed pattern matching*. This is the fastest way to compound large numbers of multi-word expressions, but make sure that `tolower = FALSE` in `textstat_collocations()` to do this.

```{r}
comp_toks2 <- tokens_compound(toks, col)
head(kwic(comp_toks2, c('United_States', 'New_York')))
```

You can use `phrase()` on collocations if more flexibility is needed. This is usually the case if you compound tokens from different corpus.

```{r}
comp_toks3 <- tokens_compound(toks, phrase(col$collocation))
head(kwic(comp_toks3, c('United_States', 'New_York')))
```
