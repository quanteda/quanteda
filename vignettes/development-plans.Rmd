## Suggestions for using quanteda during development

`quanteda` is in development and will remain so until we declare a 1.0 version, at which time we will only add new functions, not change the names of 
existing ones.  In the meantime, we suggest:

-   use named formals in the function calls, rather than relying on the current ordering of formals,
    for instance, use `clean(mytexts, removeDigits=TRUE)` instead of `clean(mytexts, TRUE)`;
-   hope that we get to 1.0 quickly;
-   help that process by sending us feedback stating what you think of the syntax, formal names, etc. from a user's perspective.

## On the To Do List

1.  Remove anything not yet implemented, e.g.: settings, resample.

2.  for the `dfm2*` functions, change to a `convert.dfm(x, to = “format”)`, instead of 3 separate functions.

3.  Do something similar for dictionary imports.

4.  Define a `textsource(x, from = c(“character”, “twitter”, “zipfiles”, “facebook”, …)` etc that returns a subclass of 
textsource that will have common attributes needed for corpus construction.  Then define different corpus() methods for 
each subclass of object?  There is probably a better way than this - we should think about it carefully - 
but it’s too anarchic at the moment, and too hard to find the range of available text sources.  
(And we can also define methods to work with all of the tm sources.)


5.  get rid of `segmentSentence`, `segmentParagraph`, just have a s`egment(x, to=“sentence”)`.

6.  Redo `stopwords` -- see pdf notes.

7.  Redo `syllableCounts` -- see pdf notes.

8.  `settings`

9.  `resample`

10. `index`
