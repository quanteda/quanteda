# Introduction

An R package for managing and analyzing text, by Ken Benoit and Paul Nulty.[^thanks]

[^thanks]: This research was supported by the European
    Research Council grant ERC-2011-StG 283794-QUANTESS.  Code
    contributors to the project include Ben Lauderdale, Pablo Barberà,
    Kohei Watanabe, and Adam Obeng.

**quanteda** makes it easy to manage texts in the form of a
corpus, defined as a collection of texts that includes document-level
variables specific to each text, as well as meta-data for documents
and for the collection as a whole.  **quanteda** includes tools to make it
easy and fast to manuipulate the texts in a corpus, by performing the most common
natural language processing tasks simply and quickly, such as tokenizing,
stemming, or forming ngrams.  **quanteda**'s functions for tokenizing texts
and forming multiple tokenized documents into a *document-feature matrix* are
both extremely fast and extremely simple to use.  **quanteda** can segment texts
easily by words, paragraphs, sentences, or even user-supplied delimiters and tags.

Built on the text processing
functions in the **stringi** package,
which is in turn built on C++ implementation of the [ICU](http://www.icu-project.org/)
libraries for Unicode text handling, **quanteda** pays special attention to fast and correct
implementation of Unicode and the handling of text in any character set, following conversion
internally to UTF-8.

**quanteda** is built for efficiency and speed, through its design around three infrastructures: the **string** package for text processing, the **data.table** package for indexing large documents efficiently, and the **Matrix** package for sparse matrix objects.  If you can fit it into memory, **quanteda** will handle it quickly.  (And eventually, we will make it possible to process objects even larger than available memory.)

**quanteda** is principally designed to allow users a fast and convenient method to go from 
a corpus of texts to a selected matrix of documents by features, after defining what 
the documents and features.  The package makes it easy to redefine documents, for instance by splitting them into sentences or paragraphs, or by tags, as well as to group them into larger documents by document variables, or to subset them based on logical conditions or combinations of document variables.  The package also implements common NLP feature selection functions, such as removing stopwords and stemming in numerous languages, selecting words found in dictionaries, treating words as equivalent based on a user-defined "thesaurus", and trimming and weighting features based on document frequency, feature frequency, and related measures such as *tf-idf*.
 
# quanteda Features

## Corpus management tools

The tools for getting texts into a corpus object include: 

* loading texts from directories of individual files
* loading texts ``manually'' by inserting them into a corpus using
  helper functions
*  managing text encodings and conversions from source files into
  corpus texts
* attaching variables to each text that can be used for grouping,
  reorganizing a corpus, or simply recording additional information to
  supplement quantitative analyses with non-textual data
* recording meta-data about the sources and creation details for
  the corpus.
  
The tools for working with a corpus include:

* summarizing the corpus in terms of its language units
* reshaping the corpus into smaller units or more aggregated units
* adding to or extracting subsets of a corpus
* resampling texts of the corpus, for example for use in
  non-parametric bootstrapping of the texts
* Easy extraction and saving, as a new data frame or corpus, key
    words in context (KWIC)

## Natural-Language Processing tools

For extracting features from a corpus, `quanteda` provides the following tools:

* extraction of word types
* extraction of word n-grams
* extraction of dictionary entries from user-defined dictionaries
* feature selection through
    - stemming
    - random selection
    - document frequency
    - word frequency
* and a variety of options for cleaning word types, such as
    capitalization and rules for handling punctuation.

## Document-Feature Matrix analysis tools

For analyzing the resulting *document-feature* matrix created
when features are abstracted from a corpus, `quanteda` provides:

* scaling methods, such as correspondence analysis, Wordfish, and Wordscores
* topic models, such as LDA
* classifiers, such as Naive Bayes or k-nearest neighbour
* sentiment analysis, using dictionaries

## Additional and planned features

**Additional features** of quanteda include:

*  the ability to explore texts using *key-words-in-context*;

*  fast computation of a variety of readability indexes;

*  fast computation of a variety of lexical diversity measures;

*  quick computation of word or document association measures, for clustering or to compute similarity scores for other purposes; and

*  a comprehensive suite of descriptive statistics on text such as the number of sentences, words, characters, or syllables per document.

**Planned features** coming soon to **quanteda** are:

*  bootstrapping methods for texts that makes it easy to resample texts
   from pre-defined units, to facilitate computation of confidence
   intervals on textual statistics using techniques of non-parametric
   bootstrapping, but applied to the original texts as data. 
   
*  expansion of the document-feature matrix structure through a standard interface called `textmodel()`.  (As of version 0.8.0, textmodel works in a basic fashion only for the "Wordscores" and "wordfish" scaling models.)


## Working with other text analysis packages

`quanteda` is hardly unique in providing facilities for working with
text -- the excellent *tm* package already provides many of the
features we have described.  `quanteda` is designed to complement those
packages, as well to simplify the implementation of the
text-to-analysis workflow.  `quanteda` corpus structures are simpler
objects than in *tm*s, as are the document-feature matrix
objects from `quanteda`, compared to the sparse matrix implementation
found in *tm*.  However, there is no need to choose only one
package, since we provide translator functions from one matrix or
corpus object to the other in `quanteda`.

Once constructed, a **quanteda** "dfm"" can be easily passed to other text-analysis packages for 
additional analysis of topic models or scaling, such as:

*  topic models (including converters for direct use with the **topicmodels**, **LDA**, and **stm** packages)

*  document scaling (using **quanteda**'s own functions for the "wordfish" and "Wordscores" models, direct use with the **ca** package for correspondence analysis, or scaling with the **austin** package)

*  document classification methods, using (for example) Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbour, or Support Vector Machines

*  more sophisticated machine learning through a variety of other packages that take matrix or matrix-like inputs.

*  graphical analysis, including word clouds and strip plots for selected themes or words.


# How to Install

As of version 0.8.0, the GitHub master repository will always contain the development version of quanteda, while the CRAN version will contain the latest "stable" version.  You therefore have two options for installing the package:

1.  From CRAN, using your R package installer, or simply

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    install.packages("quanteda")
    ```

2.  (For the development version) From GitHub, using

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    devtools::install_github("kbenoit/quanteda")
    ```

    Because this compiles some C++ source code, you will need a compiler installed.  If you are using a Windows platform, this means you will need also to install the [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) software available from CRAN.  If you are using OS X, you will probably need to install XCode, available for free from the App Store.

3.  (Optional) You can install some additional corpus data from **quantedaData** using

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    ## devtools required to install quanteda from Github
    devtools::install_github("kbenoit/quantedaData")
    ```



# Creating and Working with a Corpus

```{r show=FALSE}
require(quanteda)
```


## Currently available corpus sources

quanteda has a simple and powerful tool for loading texts: `textfile()`.  This function takes a file or fileset from disk or a URL, and loads it as a special class of pre-corpus object, known as a `corpusSource` object, from which a corpus can be constructed using a second command, `corpus()`.

`textfile()` works on:

* text (`.txt`) files;
* comma-separated-value (`.csv`) files;
* XML formatted data;
* data from the Facebook API, in JSON format;
* data from the Twitter API, in JSON format; and
* generic JSON data.

The corpus constructor command `corpus()` works directly on:

* a vector of character objects, for instance that you have already loaded into the workspace using other tools;
* a `corpusSource` object created using `textfile()`; and
* a `VCorpus` corpus object from the **tm** package.

### Example: building a corpus from a character vector

The simplest case is to create a corpus from a vector of texts already in memory in R.  This gives the advanced R user complete flexbility with his or her choice of text inputs, as there are almost endless
ways to get a vector of texts into R.

If we already have the texts in this form, we can call the corpus constructor function directly.  We can demonstrate this on the built-in character vector of 57 US president inaugural speeches called `inaugTexts`.

```{r}
str(inaugTexts)  # this gives us some information about the object
myCorpus <- corpus(inaugTexts)  # build the corpus
summary(myCorpus, n = 5)
```

If we wanted, we could add some document-level variables -- what quanteda calls `docvars` -- to this corpus.

We can do this using the R's `substring()` function to extract characters from a name -- in this case, the 
name of the character vector `inaugTexts`.  This works using our fixed starting and ending positions with
`substring()` because these names are a very regular format of `YYYY-PresidentName`.
```{r}
docvars(myCorpus, "President") <- substring(names(inaugTexts), 6)
docvars(myCorpus, "Year") <- as.integer(substring(names(inaugTexts), 1, 4))
summary(myCorpus, n=5)
```

If we wanted to tag each document with additional meta-data not considered a document variable of interest for analysis, but rather something that we need to know as an attribute of the document, we could also 
add those to our corpus.
```{r}
metadoc(myCorpus, "language") <- "english"
metadoc(myCorpus, "docsource")  <- paste("inaugTexts", 1:ndoc(myCorpus), sep = "_")
summary(myCorpus, n = 5, showmeta = TRUE)
```

The last command, `metadoc`, allows you to define your own document meta-data fields.  Note that in assiging just the single value of `"english"`, R has recycled the value until it matches the number of documents in the corpus.  In creating
a simple tag for our custom metadoc field `docsource`, we used the quanteda function `ndoc()` to retrieve
the number of documents in our corpus.  This function is deliberately designed to work in a way similar to 
functions you may already use in R, such as `nrow()` and `ncol()`.

### Example: loading in files using `textfile()`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Twitter json
mytf1 <- textfile("~/Dropbox/QUANTESS/social media/zombies/tweets.json")
myCorpusTwitter <- corpus(mytf1)
summary(myCorpusTwitter, 5)
# generic json - needs a textField specifier
mytf2 <- textfile("~/Dropbox/QUANTESS/Manuscripts/collocations/Corpora/sotu/sotu.json",
                  textField = "text")
summary(corpus(mytf2), 5)
# text file
mytf3 <- textfile("~/Dropbox/QUANTESS/corpora/project_gutenberg/pg2701.txt", cache = FALSE)
summary(corpus(mytf3), 5)
# multiple text files
mytf4 <- textfile("~/Dropbox/QUANTESS/corpora/inaugural/*.txt", cache = FALSE)
summary(corpus(mytf4), 5)
# multiple text files with docvars from filenames
mytf5 <- textfile("~/Dropbox/QUANTESS/corpora/inaugural/*.txt", 
                  docvarsfrom="filenames", sep="-", docvarnames=c("Year", "President"))
summary(corpus(mytf5), 5)
# XML data
mytf6 <- textfile("~/Dropbox/QUANTESS/quanteda_working_files/xmlData/plant_catalog.xml", 
                  textField = "COMMON")
summary(corpus(mytf6), 5)
# csv file
write.csv(data.frame(inaugSpeech = texts(inaugCorpus), docvars(inaugCorpus)), 
          file = "/tmp/inaugTexts.csv", row.names = FALSE)
mytf7 <- textfile("/tmp/inaugTexts.csv", textField = "inaugSpeech")
summary(corpus(mytf7), 5)
```

### Creating a corpus from a Twitter search

`quanteda` provides an interface to retrieve and store data from a twitter search as a corpus object. The REST API query uses the [twitteR package](https://github.com/geoffjentry/twitteR), and an API authorization from twitter is required. The process of obtaining this authorization is described in detail here: <https://openhatch.org/wiki/Community_Data_Science_Workshops/Twitter_authentication_setup>, correct as of October 2014. The twitter API is a commercial service, and rate limits and the data returned are determined by twitter.

Four keys are required, to be passed to `quanteda`'s `getTweets` source function, in addition to the search query term and the number of results required. The maximum number of results that can be obtained is not exactly identified in the API documentation, but experimentation indicates an upper bound of around 1500 results from a single query, with a frequency limit of one query per minute.

The code below performs authentication and runs a search for the string 'quantitative'. Many other functions for working with the API are available from the [twitteR package](https://github.com/geoffjentry/twitteR). An R interface to the streaming API is also available [link](link).

```{r eval=FALSE}
# These keys are examples and may not work! Get your own key at dev.twitter.com
consumer_key="vRLy03ef6OFAZB7oCL4jA"
consumer_secret="wWF35Lr1raBrPerVHSDyRftv8qB1H7ltV0T3Srb3s"
access_token="1577780816-wVbOZEED8KZs70PwJ2q5ld2w9CcvcZ2kC6gPnAo"
token_secret="IeC6iYlgUK9csWiP524Jb4UNM8RtQmHyetLi9NZrkJA"


tw <- getTweets('quantitative', numResults=20, consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, token_secret)
```

The return value from the above query is a source object which can be passed to quanteda's corpus constructor, and the document variables are set to correspond with tweet metadata returned by the API.

```{r eval=FALSE}
twCorpus <- corpus(tw)
names(docvars(twCorpus))
```



## How a quanteda corpus works

### Corpus principles

A corpus is designed to be a "library" of original documents that have been converted to plain, UTF-8 encoded text, and stored along with meta-data at the corpus level and at the document-level.  We have a special name for document-level meta-data: *docvars*.  These are variables or features that describe attributes of each document.

A corpus is designed to be a more or less static container of texts with respect to processing and analysis.  This means that the texts in corpus are not designed to be changed internally through (for example) cleaning or pre-processing steps, such as stemming or removing punctuation.  Rather, texts can be extracted from the corpus as part of processing, and assigned to new objects, but the idea is that the corpus will remain as an original reference copy so that other analyses -- for instance those in which stems and punctuation were required, such as analyzing a reading ease index -- can be performed on the same corpus.

To extract texts from a a corpus, we use an extractor, called `texts()`.  

```{r}
texts(inaugCorpus)[2]
```

To summarize the texts from a corpus, we can call a `summary()` method defined for a corpus.

```{r}
summary(ie2010Corpus)
```

We can save the output from the summary command as a data frame, and plot some basic descriptive statistics with this information:

```{r}
tokenInfo <- summary(inaugCorpus)
if (require(ggplot2))
    ggplot(data=tokenInfo, aes(x=Year, y=Tokens, group=1)) + geom_line() + geom_point() +
        scale_x_discrete(labels=c(seq(1789,2012,12)), breaks=seq(1789,2012,12) ) 

# Longest inaugural address: William Henry Harrison
tokenInfo[which.max(tokenInfo$Tokens),] 
```


## Tools for handling corpus objects

### Adding two corpus objects together

The `+` operator provides a simple method for concatenating two corpus objects.  If they contain
different sets of document-level variables, these will be stitched together in a fashion that guarantees
that no information is lost.  Corpus-level medata data is also concatenated.

```{r}
library(quanteda)
mycorpus1 <- corpus(inaugTexts[1:5], note = "First five inaug speeches.")
mycorpus2 <- corpus(inaugTexts[53:57], note = "Last five inaug speeches.")
mycorpus3 <- mycorpus1 + mycorpus2
summary(mycorpus3)
```

### subsetting corpus objects

There is a method of the `subset()` function defined for corpus objects, where a new corpus can 
be extracted based on logical conditions applied to docvars:

```{r}
summary(subset(inaugCorpus, Year > 1990))
summary(subset(inaugCorpus, President == "Adams"))
```


## Exploring corpus texts

The `kwic` function (KeyWord In Context) performs a search for a word and allows us to view the contexts in which it occurs:

```{r}
options(width = 200)
kwic(inaugCorpus, "terror")
kwic(inaugCorpus, "terror", valuetype = "regex")
kwic(inaugCorpus, "communist*")
```


In the above summary, `Year` and `President` are variables associated with each document. We can access such variables with the `docvars()` function.

```{r}
# inspect the document-level variables
head(docvars(inaugCorpus))

# inspect the corpus-level metadata
metacorpus(inaugCorpus)
```

More corpora are available from the [quantedaData](http://github.com/kbenoit/quantedaData) package.




# Extracting Features from a Corpus

In order to perform statistical analysis such as document scaling, we
must extract a matrix associating values for certain features with each
document. In quanteda, we use the `dfm` function to produce such a matrix.  "dfm" is short for *document-feature matrix*, and always refers to documents
in rows and "features" as columns.  We fix this dimensional orientation because is is 
standard in data analysis to have a unit of analysis as a row, and features or variables
pertaining to each unit as columns.  We call them "features" rather than terms, because
features are more general than terms: they can be defined as raw terms, stemmed terms, the parts of speech of terms, terms after stopwords have been removed,
or a dictionary class to which a term belongs.  Features can be entirely general, such as ngrams or syntactic dependencies, and we leave this open-ended.

## Tokenizing texts

To simply tokenize a text, quanteda provides a powerful command called `tokenize()`.  This produces an 
intermediate object, consisting of a list of tokens in the form of character vectors, where each element
of the list corresponds to an input document.

`tokenize()` is deliberately conservative, meaning that it does not remove anything from the text unless
told to do so.

```{r}
txt <- c(text1 = "This is $10 in 999 different ways,\n up and down; left and right!", 
         text2 = "@kenbenoit working: on #quanteda 2day\t4ever, http://textasdata.com?page=123.")
tokenize(txt)
tokenize(txt, removeNumbers = TRUE, removePunct = TRUE)
tokenize(txt, removeNumbers = FALSE, removePunct = TRUE)
tokenize(txt, removeNumbers = TRUE, removePunct = FALSE)
tokenize(txt, removeNumbers = FALSE, removePunct = FALSE)
tokenize(txt, removeNumbers = FALSE, removePunct = FALSE, removeSeparators = FALSE)
```

We also have the option to tokenize characters:
```{r}
tokenize("Great website: http://textasdata.com?page=123.", what = "character")
tokenize("Great website: http://textasdata.com?page=123.", what = "character", 
         removeSeparators = FALSE)
```

and sentences:
```{r}
# sentence level         
tokenize(c("Kurt Vongeut said; only assholes use semi-colons.", 
           "Today is Thursday in Canberra:  It is yesterday in London.", 
           "En el caso de que no puedas ir con ellos, ¿quieres ir con nosotros?"), 
          what = "sentence")
```

## Constructing a document-frequency matrix

Tokenizing texts is an intermediate option, and most users will want to skip straight to constructing
a document-feature matrix.  For this, we have a Swiss-army knife function, called `dfm()`, which performs
tokenization and tabulates the extracted features into a matrix of documents by features.  Unlike
the conservative approach taken by `tokenize()`, the `dfm()` function applies certain options by default,
such as `toLower()` -- a separate function for lower-casing texts -- and removes punctuation.  All of the options to `tokenize()` can be passed to `dfm()`, however.

```{r}
myCorpus <- subset(inaugCorpus, Year > 1990)

# make a dfm
myDfm <- dfm(myCorpus)
myDfm[, 1:5]
```

Other options for a `dfm()` include removing stopwords, and stemming the tokens.
```{r}
# make a dfm, removing stopwords and applying stemming
myStemMat <- dfm(myCorpus, ignoredFeatures = stopwords("english"), stem = TRUE)
myStemMat[, 1:5]
```

The option `ignoredFeatures` provides a list of tokens to be ignored.  Most users will 
supply a list of pre-defined "stop words", defined for numerous languages, accessed through 
the `stopwords()` function:
```{r}
head(stopwords("english"), 20)
head(stopwords("russian"), 10)
head(stopwords("arabic"), 10)
```



### Viewing the document-frequency matrix

The dfm can be inspected in the Enviroment pane in RStudio, or by calling R's `View` function. Calling `plot` on a dfm will display a wordcloud using the [wordcloud package](link.)
```{r warning=FALSE}
mydfm <- dfm(ukimmigTexts, ignoredFeatures=c("will", stopwords("english")))
mydfm
```

To access a list of the most frequently occurring features, we can use `topfeatures()`:
```{r}
topfeatures(mydfm, 20)  # 20 top words
```

Plotting a word cloud is very simple, since this is the default `plot()` method for a `dfm` class object:
```{r warning=FALSE}
plot(mydfm)
```

The `plot.dfm()` method passes arguments through to `wordcloud()` from the **wordcloud** package, and can prettify the plot using the same arguments:
```{r warning=FALSE}
if (require(RColorBrewer))
    plot(mydfm, max.words = 100, colors = brewer.pal(6, "Dark2"), scale = c(8, .5))
```

### Grouping documents by document variable 

Often, we are interested in analysing how texts differ according to substantive factors which may be encoded in the document variables, rather than simply by the boundaries of the document files. We can group documents which share the same value for a document variable when creating a dfm:

```{r}
byPartyDfm <- dfm(ie2010Corpus, groups = "party", ignoredFeatures = stopwords("english"))
```

We can sort this dfm, and inspect it:
```{r}
sort(byPartyDfm)[, 1:10]
```

Note that the most frequently occurring feature is "will", a word usually on English stop lists, but
one that is not included in quanteda's built-in English stopword list.  


### Grouping words by dictionary or equivalence class

For some applications we have prior knowledge of sets of words that are indicative of traits we would like to measure from the text. For example, a general list of positive words might indicate positive sentiment in a movie review, or we might have a dictionary of political terms which are associated with a particular ideological stance. In these cases, it is sometimes useful to treat these groups of words as equivalent for the purposes of analysis, and sum their counts into classes. 

For example, let's look at how words associated with terrorism and words associated with the economy vary by President in the inaugural speeches corpus. From the original corpus, we select Presidents since Clinton:

```{r}
recentCorpus <- subset(inaugCorpus, Year > 1991)
```

Now we define a demonstration dictionary:
```{r}
myDict <- dictionary(list(terror = c("terrorism", "terrorists", "threat"),
                          economy = c("jobs", "business", "grow", "work")))
```


We can use the dictionary when making the dfm:
```{r}
byPresMat <- dfm(recentCorpus, dictionary = myDict)
byPresMat
```

The constructor function `dictionary()` also works with two common "foreign" dictionary formats: the 
LIWC and Provalis Research's Wordstat format.  For instance, we can load the LIWC and apply this to the Presidential inaugural speech corpus:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
liwcdict <- dictionary(file = "~/Dropbox/QUANTESS/dictionaries/LIWC/LIWC2001_English.dic",
                       format = "LIWC")
liwcdfm <- dfm(inaugTexts[52:57], dictionary = liwcdict, verbose = FALSE)
liwcdfm[, 1:10]
```



# Further Examples

## Similarities between texts

```{r}
presDfm <- dfm(subset(inaugCorpus, Year>1980), 
               ignoredFeatures = stopwords("english"),
               stem=TRUE, verbose=FALSE)
obamaSimil <- similarity(presDfm, c("2009-Obama" , "2013-Obama"), n = NULL, 
                            margin = "documents", method = "cosine", normalize = FALSE)
dotchart(obamaSimil$`2009-Obama`, xlab = "Cosine similarity")
```


We can use these distances to plot a dendrogram, clustering presidents:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
data(SOTUCorpus, package="quantedaData")
presDfm <- dfm(subset(SOTUCorpus, year > 1960), verbose = FALSE, stem = TRUE,
               ignoredFeatures = stopwords("english"))
presDfm <- trim(presDfm, minCount=5, minDoc=3)
# hierarchical clustering - get distances on normalized dfm
presDistMat <- dist(as.matrix(weight(presDfm, "relFreq")))
# hiarchical clustering the distance object
presCluster <- hclust(presDistMat)
# label with document names
presCluster$labels <- docnames(presDfm)
# plot as a dendrogram
plot(presCluster)
```



We can also look at term similarities:
```{r}
similarity(presDfm, c("fair", "health", "terror"), method = "cosine", margin = "features", n = 20)
```

## Scaling document positions

We have a lot of development work to do on the `textmodel()` function, but here is a demonstration of unsupervised document scaling comparing the "wordfish" model to scaling from correspondence analysis:
```{r}
# make prettier document names
docnames(ie2010Corpus) <- 
    paste(docvars(ie2010Corpus, "name"), docvars(ie2010Corpus, "party"))
ieDfm <- dfm(ie2010Corpus, verbose = FALSE)
wf <- textmodel(ieDfm, model = "wordfish", dir=c(2,1))
wca <- textmodel(ieDfm, model = "ca")
# plot the results
plot(wf@theta, -1*wca$rowcoord[,1], 
     xlab="Wordfish theta-hat", ylab="CA dim 1 coordinate", pch=19)
text(wf@theta, -1*wca$rowcoord[,1], docnames(ieDfm), cex=.8, pos=1)
abline(lm(-1*wca$rowcoord[,1] ~ wf@theta), col="grey50", lty="dotted")
```

## Topic models

```{r}
quantdfm <- dfm(ie2010Corpus, verbose = FALSE, 
                ignoredFeatures = c("will", stopwords("english")))

if (require(topicmodels)) {
    myLDAfit20 <- LDA(convert(quantdfm, to = "topicmodels"), k = 20)
    get_terms(myLDAfit20, 5)
    topics(myLDAfit20, 3)
}
```
