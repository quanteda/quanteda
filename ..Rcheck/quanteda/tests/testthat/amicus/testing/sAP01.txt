This litigation involves not a challenge to "affirmative action" simpliciter, whether understood as the use of race-conscious remedies for proven race-based discrimination by state actors or outreach efforts to communicate the University of Michigan's equal opportunity and non-discrimination policies as a means of enlarging the pool of applicants. Rather, seizing on Justice Powell's endorsement of "educational  [*2]  diversity" as a possible compelling state interest for equal protection purposes in Regents of the Univ. of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), the University and its Law School have sought to justify an admissions scheme that explicitly seeks to ensure the admission each year of a "critical mass" of students from selected minority and ethnic groups. The University's undergraduate schools strive to accomplish this objective by automatically awarding 20 points (out of a total of 150 points) for membership in particular minority groups; the Law School pursues this end by monitoring applications to ensure that members from favored minority groups comprise 10-17 percent of its student body. Expert opinion, credited below, indicated that membership in certain racial and ethnic groups increased the odds of Law School acceptance "many, many (tens to hundreds) times" that of similarly situated non-minority applicants. 

Respondents' reliance on Justice Powell's Bakke position is problematic because Powell's discussion of diversity reflected the views of only one member of the Court and did not state a holding even in that case since a program of the type he suggested he would favor was not before the Court. Moreover, his position that educational diversity might provide a compelling justification for government use of race has never commanded the support of a majority of the Court. But even under the terms of the Powell opinion, the University's pursuit of a "critical mass" of minority students through racial and ethnic preferences cannot be squared with Justice Powell's insistence on a truly individualized assessment of the merits of applicants in which individuals are treated as individuals; race serves as only one among many factors potentially contributing to a diverse educational experience; and all applicants are placed "on the same footing for consideration" irrespective of race or ethnicity. 

Respondents' "critical mass" rationale is entirely at odds with the very notion of an individualized consideration as  [*3]  envisioned in the Powell opinion. Respondents justify the need for a "critical mass" in order to provide a supportive environment to enable minority students to discuss freely their experience. Whatever its merits as a pedagogic tool, "critical mass" calculations inevitably elide into notions of appropriate group representation. They have "no logical stopping place," a critical deficiency under "strict scrutiny" analysis as Justice Powell emphasized in his opinion for the plurality in Wygant v. Jackson Board of Educ., 467 U.S. 267 (1986), and Justice O'Connor reaffirmed in her opinion for the plurality in City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson, 488 U.S. 469 (1989). Indeed, if sustained as a matter of equal protection, they provide the very path to a societal "spoils system," the avoidance of which prompted Justice Powell in Bakke and Wygant, the plurality in Croson, and the Court in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200 (1995), to insist on "strict scrutiny" whenever government uses race or ethnicity to allocate public resources or burdens. 

Twenty-five years after Bakke, it may be time for the Court to make clear that educational or pedagogic diversity, while a desirable objective, cannot be pursued through government awards of racial or ethnic preferences. Because such preferences reflect outright racial stereotyping about how people will (or should) think or behave on account of their skin color or ethnicity, they cut against bedrock constitutional principle that forbids government to judge individuals as members of racial or ethnic groups. Whether or not individuals from historically disadvantaged groups may derive some advantage from these programs, the state's awarding of valuable opportunities on the basis of skin color or ancestry necessarily diminishes those who are not benefited and, more importantly, erodes the national fabric and commitment to equality of opportunity. 

Respondents' position is no less constitutionally infirm even if it were to abandon its doubtful claim that race is an  [*4]  appropriate proxy for viewpoint diversity and predicate its preferential admissions scheme on the need to provide useful lessons in group tolerance for non-minority students or, more likely, appropriate representation of certain minority groups in selective institutions of higher learning. Because of the availability of a great many race-neutral means of furthering a message of tolerance, the University's empathy/tolerance rationale simply does not exhibit the element of necessity, of overriding justification, required of a "compelling" justification that comports with equal protection. 

The University's group-representation rationale is likely what animates preferential admissions policies in the nation's elite institutions of higher learning. Here, preferences serve principally not to enlarge the supply of qualified minority students but, rather, to distribute that supply in favor of the more selective schools. In any event, the use of race and ethnicity simply to ensure a desired racial and ethnic representation plainly fails "strict scrutiny" review, as this Court has made clear in Croson, Adarand, and Voting Rights Act cases like Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900 (1995). 

Respondents and their amici are likely to argue that legitimate reliance interests will be unraveled by a ruling striking down the University's racial and ethnic preferential admissions program. This claim lacks all merit as (1) Justice Powell's discussion of the "Harvard Plan" in Bakke was not necessary to resolve the merits of the "reserved places" or "set aside" plan struck down in that case; (2) respondents' use of race and ethnic preferences exceeds, by a good margin, the limited consideration of race envisioned in the Powell opinion; (3) respondents and other public universities have been put on notice at least since this Court's 1995 ruling in Adarand that all government classifications based on race would receive "strict scrutiny" and, in light of its prior rulings in Wygant and Croson, nonremedial use of race would likely trigger an especially heavy burden of justification; and (4) the  [*5]  constitutionality of public university use of race and ethnicity in admissions decisions has been heavily contested in the lower courts. In short, respondents simply have taken an aggressive view of what the Constitution permits, hardly a basis for arguing reliance on well-established constitutional precedent in their favor. 

 [*14]  ARGUMENT 

I. THE USE OF RACIAL OR ETHNIC PREFERENCES TO ACHIEVE A "CRITICAL MASS" OF MINORITY ADMISSIONS EXCEEDS THE LIMITED PRIVILEGE, RECOGNIZED IN JUSTICE POWELL'S OPINION IN BAKKE, PERMITTING CONSIDERATION OF RACE AS ONLY ONE FACTOR IN A TRULY INDIVIDUALIZED DETERMINATION OF THE MERITS OF APPLICANTS. 

Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke reflects the nowestablished view of the Court that any use by the state of racial and ethnic classifications is subject to the "strict scrutiny" standard of judicial review, even where such classifications purportedly work to the "benefit" of members of minority groups. n10 See, e.g., Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.  [*15]  Pena, 515 U.S. 200 (1995); City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson, 488 U.S. 469 (1989). There is, however, a substantial question whether that portion of Justice Powell's opinion stating that educational diversity could supply a "compelling" justification for a state university's consideration of the racial and ethnic backgrounds of applicants--a view embraced by none of the other Justices in Bakke n11--constituted a holding even in that case. Because the University of California at Davis set aside specific places for minority students, Justice Powell (and four other members of the Court) voted to strike down the Davis program. A university program that used race or ethnicity as only one factor among many was not before the Court in Bakke. n12 

n10 Whether such classifications in fact "benefit" the claimed beneficiaries of such programs is highly contested, even among members of those groups. See, e.g., John H. McWhorter, LOSING THE RACE: SELF-SABOTAGE IN BLACK AMERICA 225-26 (2000) (supporting temporary preferences in employment as a response to discrimination, but disapproving their use in university admissions where "the evidence suggests that most of the black-white disparity is today due to a sense of separation from scholarly endeavor internal to African-American culture."); Shelby Steele, A DREAM DEFERRED: THE SECOND BETRAYAL OF BLACK FREEDOM IN AMERICA 34 (1998) ("Double standards, preferential treatment, provisions for 'cultural difference,'. . . all constitute a form of exceptionalism that keeps blacks (and other minorities) down by tolerating weakness at every juncture where strength is expected of others."); see also Steele, The Age of White Guilt (and the Disappearance of the Black Individual), HARPER'S MAGAZINE, Nov. 2002, pp. 33 ff. Moreover, recent poll data suggest that minority communities generally express similar disquiet over the use of racial and ethnic preferences. Thus, for example, a 2001 survey, conducted by the Washington Post, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, and Harvard University, indicates that 86% of African-Americans and 84% of Hispanic Americans believe that employment and university admissions decisions should be based strictly on merit and not include use of race or ethnicity as a factor. See Washington Post/Kaiser/Harvard Racial Attitudes Survey, Question 50, available at http://www.washingtonpost.com/wpsrv/nation/sidebars/polls/race071101.htm 

n11 Judge Boggs, dissenting in the Court of Appeals' ruling in Grutter, pointedly observed: "Nowhere in Justice Brennan's opinion does he mention the diversity rationale, and he explicitly did not join Part IV-D of Justice Powell's opinion, discussing the diversity rationale." 288 F.3d at 781; Grutter Pet. App., p. 100a. 

n12 See Alan J. Meese, Reinventing Bakke, 1 GREEN BAG 2d 381 (Summer 1998). 

Moreover, it is doubtful that Justice Powell's position on the diversity question has ever commanded the support of a majority of the Court. Indeed, the Court's past rejection of a number of nonremedial justifications for race-based preferences casts considerable doubt on the viability of the diversity rationale. See Croson, 488 U.S. at 506 (rejecting "societal discrimination" rationale for use of race which, if sustained, would produce a "mosaic of shifting preferences based on inherently unmeasurable claims of past wrongs"); Wygant v. Jackson Board of Educ., 467 U.S. 267 (1986) (rejecting "role model" theory for race-based protection of  [*16]  black teachers from layoffs not tied to demonstrated employment discrimination); Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S. 495 (2000) (rejecting under the Fifteenth Amendment "self-governance" and fiduciary-beneficiary theories for limiting voting rights to individuals of Hawaiian ancestry concerning elections for state agency administering programs for the benefit of Hawaiian citizenry). n13 

n13 In Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U.S. 547 (1990), a 5-4 majority of the Court sustained two FCC race-based programs. That decision, involving a Fifth Amendment challenge, used an "intermediate" standard of scrutiny later rejected in Adarand. Although the Court in Adarand expressly overruled only Metro Broadcasting's failure to engage in the "strict scrutiny" analysis required of all government use of race in allocating economic opportunities, see 515 U.S. at 227, it is doubtful that a similar agency program would be sustained after Adarand. 

We further note that Justice Powell's Bakke opinion was significantly informed by a perceived First Amendment interest in according a measure of "academic freedom" in the running of public institutions of higher learning. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 311-13. That aspect of Justice Powell's opinion is difficult to square, however, with longstanding federal legislation, consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, insisting on non-discrimination in all decisions taken by state actors, including universities. See, e.g., Title VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d & 2000e et seq. It would also seem at least implicitly rejected in Bob Jones University v. United States, 461 U.S. 574 (1982). In that case, seven members of the Court (including Justice Powell) rejected a First Amendment challenge to the federal government's denial of tax-exempt status to a private university that maintained racially discriminatory admissions standards on the basis of religious doctrine. Noting statutes such as Title VI, see id. at 594, Chief Justice Burger stated for the Court: "Whatever may be the rationale for such private schools' policies, and however sincere the rationale may be, racial discrimination in  [*17]  education is contrary to public policy. Racially discriminatory educational institutions cannot be viewed as conferring a public benefit within the 'charitable' concept [underlying the federal tax law]." Id. at 595-96. 

Nevertheless, because respondents and the Court of Appeals below relied principally on Justice Powell's Bakke opinion, and that opinion marks the constitutional frontier respecting the allowable consideration of race in state-university admissions decisions, we assume for purposes of this part of the brief that Justice Powell's view--that a state university's pursuit of educational or pedagogic "diversity" can justify some consideration of the race or ethnic status of applicants--does reflect a majority position on the Court. 

Even under Justice Powell's view, however, the University of Michigan's admissions system violates the Equal Protection Clause. Even if diversity can supply a compelling justification for some consideration of race, respondents' preferential admissions programs fail the constitutional test because the means chosen are not "narrowly tailored" to achieving the stated educational objective. 

Respondents properly note that, at least in its current form, their deployment of racial and ethnic preferences is subtler than the University of California at Davis's "set aside" or "reserved spaces" approach struck down in Bakke. However, they and the appeals court below fail to appreciate that Justice Powell's limited endorsement of the consideration of race presupposed a particular framework for university admissions decisions. Justice Powell assumed such consideration would take place only as part of a truly individualized assessment of the merits of each applicant, including the individual's potential contribution to a diverse student body broadly understood to include all aspects of diversity. The state interest that "would justify consideration of race or ethnic background," Justice Powell wrote, is "not an interest in simple ethnic diversity," but rather "encompasses a far  [*18]  broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element." 438 U.S. at 315 (emphasis supplied). 

For Justice Powell, the use of race might be justified when it operates as a tie-breaker among otherwise equally qualified applicants enjoying the same measure of individualized assessment. Endorsing Harvard College's self-description of its diversity admissions program (discussed as a matter of judicial notice), Justice Powell observed:
  
"This kind of program treats each applicant as an individual in the admissions process. The applicant that loses out on the last available seat to another candidate receiving a 'plus' will not have been foreclosed from all consideration for that seat because he was not of the right color or had the wrong surname. It would mean only that his combined qualifications, which may have included similar nonobjective factors, did not outweigh those of the other applicant. His qualifications would have been weighed fairly and competitively, and he would have no basis to complain of unequal treatment under the Fourteenth Amendment." Id. at 318 emphasis supplied. n14


n14 Although coming to the issue with a very different political and judicial philosophy, Justice Douglas, dissenting in DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312 (1974), held a similar view on the essentially individualized nature of the educational-diversity inquiry permitted under equal protection principles: 

"The key to the problem is consideration of such applications in a racially neutral way . . . . There is . . . no bar to considering an individual's prior achievements in light of the racial discrimination that barred his way, as a factor in attempting to assess his true potential for a successful legal career. Nor is there any bar to considering on an individual basis, rather than according to racial classifications, the likelihood that a particular candidate will be more likely to employ his legal skills to service communities that are not now adequately represented than will competing candidates. Not every student benefited by such an expanded admissions program would fall into one of the four racial groups involved here, but it is no drawback that other deserving applicants will also get an opportunity they would otherwise have been denied." original emphasis Id. at 340-41. 

 [*19]  The key, for Justice Powell, was individualized review of the merits of applicants, each placed "on the same footing for consideration":
  
"The file of a particular black student may be examined for his potential contribution for diversity when compared, for example, with that of an applicant identified as an Italian-American if the latter is thought to exhibit qualities likely to promote beneficial educational pluralism . . . . In short, an admissions program operated in this way is flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant, and to place them on the same footing for consideration, although not necessarily according them the same weight." Id. at 317 (emphasis supplied).
Respondents and the Court of Appeals stress the fact that, unlike the program in Bakke, the University's preferential admissions programs (as presently structured) do not reserve slots for particular minority groups; there is no "set aside" as such; and at all times the merits of applicants from preferred minority groups are assessed against those from non-preferred groups. But, given the findings below, this is merely a formalistic point. Here, there is no dispute that
  
The University's LSA automatically gives each applicant from preferred minority groups an extra 20 points (out of a total of 150 points) that non-minorities do not receive solely because of their race or ethnic origin; the Law School is committed to admitting a "critical mass" of preferred minority students, somewhere along the range of 10 to 17% of the student  [*20]  body every year; and the record evidence is clear that being of a preferred race or ethnic group boosts the odds of acceptance "many (tens to hundreds) times" that of a similarly situated applicant from non-favored groups.
  
It is thus clear that for the University of Michigan, all applicants are not on "the same footing for consideration" regardless of their race or ethnicity. 

Were the situation reversed and, say, a historically black college employed a similar commitment to admitting a "critical mass" of Caucasian students, it would seem highly doubtful that such an admissions program would pass constitutional muster. As Justice Powell made clear in Bakke, and as expressly affirmed in Croson, 488 U.S. at 494, and Adarand, 515 U.S. at 218, "the guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when applied to one individual, and something else when applied to a person of another color." Bakke, 438 U.S. at 289-90 (opinion of Powell, J.). 

Whereas the University's LSA practice of automatically awarding favored minority applicants an extra 20 points is quite difficult to reconcile with the tie-breaking, individualized consideration envisioned by Justice Powell, the Law School's "critical mass" concept is entirely at odds with the very notion of individualized consideration. If we put aside for later discussion whether the epistemic or other pedagogic benefits of ensuring classroom representation of members of particular minority groups hold up under analysis, the Law School plainly has engaged in a use of race and ethnicity that cannot plausibly be justified in terms of Justice Powell's Bakke opinion. 

Respondents' own expert testified in the Grutter litigation that if the Law School could not consider race, minority students from the preferred under-represented minority categories would have constituted "only 4% of the entering class instead of the actual enrollment of 14.5%." 288 F.3d at 732; Grutter Pet. App., pp. 8a-9a. Given the elusive nature of  [*21]  the diversity rationale, it is difficult to say whether 4% of the entering class would be sufficient to achieve the desired pedagogic benefits. There is no finding below--indeed, respondents do not argue--that it would be insufficient. 

Rather, respondents argue that a "critical mass" of minority students is needed to create a protective environment so that those students "do not feel isolated or like spokespersons for their race, and feel comfortable discussing issues freely based on their own personal experiences," 137 F.Supp. 2d at 834; id. at 211a (referring to testimony of Dean Lehman). Of course, this stated concern for the comfort level of preferred minority students, viewed as members of groups, is a bit at logger-heads with an individualized conception of the contribution to viewpoint diversity thought to inhere in an individual of a particular race or ethnicity. Moreover, contrary to respondents' sociological assumption, other educators have found that the use of racial preferences to ensure the presence of a "critical mass" of presumably like-minded minority students may serve more to reinforce race-based thinking on the part of those students than to liberate them to consider themselves as individuals. n15 But even if we assume that respondents' views on the pedagogic benefits of achieving a "critical mass" must be accepted, we have moved quite a distance from the individualized inquiry into the content of the character of each applicant approved in Justice Powell's opinion. 

n15 See, e.g., McWhorter, LOSING THE RACE, supra, at 80 (discussing a black student who "spiritually had ensconced himself in 'black Berkeley,' living on a black dormitory floor and majoring in African-American Studies . . . So determinedly reserving his sincere and open engagement for interactions with blacks only, he, too, is likely to have some trouble getting internships and jobs, and will be warmly supported by his friends in attributing this to racism."). 

"Critical mass" calculations inevitably elide into notions of appropriate group representation. Is every minority group in the student body equally entitled to "critical mass"  [*22]  representation so that those students also do not feel isolated or that they must act as spokespersons for their group? As Judge Boggs, dissenting in Grutter, observed:
  
"Since the Law School gives no principles, sociological or otherwise, by which the 'non-representativeness' of individual group members can be judged, we have to assume that a 'critical mass' would be of approximately the same size for any designated group. Thus, Afghans, Orthodox Jews, Appalachian Celts, or fundamentalist Christians might also feel that their remarks were being taken as representative, rather than individually, unless they, too, had a 'critical mass.' Then, the makeup of the entering class could be wholly determined by these groups that the Law School chose to classify as appropriate for worrying about their 'under-represented status.'" 288 F.3d at 806; Grutter Pet. App., p. 151a (Boggs, J., dissenting).
There is "no logical stopping point" for such use of race, a critical deficiency under "strict scrutiny" analysis, as Justice Powell stressed, writing for the plurality in Wygant, 476 U.S. at 275, and Justice O'Connor reaffirmed in her opinion for the plurality in Croson, 488 U.S. at 498. Herein lies the very path to a societal "spoils system," the avoidance of which prompted Justice Powell in Bakke and Wygant, the plurality in Croson, and the Court in Adarand to insist on "strict scrutiny" whenever government uses race or ethnicity to allocate public resources or burdens. 

II. PURSUIT OF EDUCATIONAL OR PEDAGOGIC DIVERSITY DOES NOT PROVIDE A COMPELLING JUSTIFICATION FOR THE USE OF RACIAL OR ETHNIC PREFERENCES UNDER THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE. 

Twenty-five years after Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke, it may be time for the Court to make clear that educational or pedagogic diversity, while a desirable objective, cannot be  [*23]  pursued through government awards of racial or ethnic preferences. This is so even if the Court is not prepared to implement fully the plurality's suggestion in Croson that nonremedial use of race is a per se violation of equal protection: "Classifications based on race carry a danger of stigmatic harm. Unless they are strictly reserved for remedial settings, they may in fact promote notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility." 488 U.S. at 493-94 (emphasis supplied), citing Bakke, 438 U.S. at 298 (opinion of Powell, J.). 

The "diversity" justification is based on a host of assumptions that reflect outright racial stereotyping--that only black students can provide the necessary critical perspective on the nation's racist past, that only black instructors can teach African-American studies, that only black policemen can instill confidence and evoke a cooperative spirit in minority neighborhoods, that tolerance and the virtues of cultural diversity can be effectively communicated only by persons of the requisite skin color or ethnicity. n16 State action "'based on the demeaning notion that members of the defined racial groups ascribe to certain 'minority views' that must be different from those of other citizens'" presents "the precise use of race as a proxy the Constitution prohibits." Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 914 (1995) (emphasis added), quoting Metro Broadcasting, 497 U.S. at 636 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). The Constitution, simply put, "provides that the Government may not allocate benefits and burdens among individuals based on the assumption that race or ethnicity determines how they act or think." Metro Broadcasting, 497 U.S. at 602 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). n17 

n16 Race-conscious action for remedial purposes need not embody such race-based assumptions about how people (should) think and act. See generally Eugene Volokh, Diversity, Race as Proxy, and Religion as Proxy, 43 U.C.L.A. L. REV. 2059 (1996). 

n17 Even in the context of otherwise wholly discretionary peremptory challenges of jurors, the Court has made clear that "race cannot be a proxy for determining juror bias or competence. We may not accept as a defense to racial discrimination the very stereotype the law condemns." Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410 (1991) (citations omitted). 

 [*24]  After this Court's clear message in Croson and Adarand, it is no longer adequate to say that the University's use of race as a proxy for desired viewpoints embodies no element of invidious discrimination or stigma simply because it operates for the presumed benefit of previously disadvantaged groups. n18 Invidious comparisons are necessarily made when the state assumes that some people bring more value to an institution than others who are equally if not more qualified (as determined by the institution's own generally applicable standards) simply because they have a certain skin color or ethnicity. n19 Such group-based assumptions about how  [*25]  individuals act or think, however plausible in particular cases, cut against bedrock constitutional principle:
  
"One of the principal reasons race is treated as a forbidden classification is that it demeans the dignity and worth of a person to be judged by ancestry instead of his or her own merit and essential qualities. An inquiry into ancestral lines is not consistent with a respect based on the unique personality each of us possesses, a respect the Constitution itself secures in its concern for persons and citizens." Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S. at 517.


n18 But see note 10 supra. 

n19 Diversity rationales often embody comparative judgments of the presumed differing contributions of particular groups. While Justice Powell in Bakke endorsed the modern, enlightened "Harvard Plan," an earlier Harvard admissions policy also spoke in terms of the cultural values of diversity:
"Race is a part of the record. It is by no means the whole record, and no man will be kept out on grounds of race; but those racial characteristics which make for race isolation will, if they are borne by the individual, be taken into consideration as part of that individual's characteristics under the test of character, personality, and promise."
  
The New Admissions Plan, THE GADFLY (May 1926), p. 4, quoted in Alan M. Dershowitz & Laura Hanft, Affirmative Action and the Harvard College Diversity-Discretion Model: Paradigm Or Pretext, 1 CARDOZO L. REV. 379, 391 (1979); see 288 F.3d at 793-94; Grutter Pet. App. 125a-126a (Boggs, J., dissenting) (quoting then Harvard president Lowell's "hauntingly similar" views). As Judge Boggs noted in his Grutter dissent, "race" and "character" were used by Harvard as code words for limiting the number of Jewish students: "Harvard in the 1930's did not have to say that exactly 87 percent of the seats were set aside for Gentiles--it just had to apply an admissions system based on 'character' that achieved roughly the same result." 288 F.3d at 801 & n.28; id. at 141a & n.28. See generally Daniel A. Farber & Suzanna Sherry, BEYOND ALL REASON: THE RADICIAL ASSAULT ON TRUTH IN AMERICAN LAW (1997). 

The University's preferential admissions programs are constitutionally infirm even if, in an unguarded moment, it is revealed that students from particular minority groups are preferred, not because they are likely to articulate particular views, n20 but because their very presence in the classroom  [*26]  teaches useful lessons in empathy or tolerance for non-minority students, or to ensure appropriate representation of minority groups in selective institutions of higher learning. n21 

n20 Former University of Michigan Law School Dean Terrance Sandalow, a noted constitutional scholar in his own right, acknowledges:
  
"My own experience and that of colleagues with whom I have discussed the question, experience that concededly is limited to the classroom setting, is that racial diversity is not responsible for generating ideas unfamiliar to some members of the class. Students do, of course, quite frequently express and develop ideas that others in the class have not previously encountered, but even though the subjects I teach deal extensively with racial issues, I cannot recall an instance in which, for example, ideas were expressed by a black student that have not also been expressed by white students. Black students do, at times, call attention to the racial implications of issues that are not facially concerned with race, but white and Asian-American students are in my experience no less likely to do so."
Terrance Sandalow, Book Review, 97 MICH. L. REV. 1874, 1906-07 (1999). Rather, Dean Sandalow adds, the contribution that representation of minority groups in the classroom may make to the educational experience "depends less upon the idea expressed than upon the identity of the speaker and the manner of expression." Id. at 1907. While "useful," "the extent of the contribution needs to be kept in perspective," for "the development of a capacity for empathic understanding of ideas and experiences different from one's own . . . does not depend upon it [i.e., representation of particular minority groups in the classroom]." Id. 

n21 Both rationales are stated in the Law School's bulletin for the 1996-1997 academic year. See 137 F.Supp. at 829; Grutter Pet. App. 201a. 

As for the empathy/tolerance rationale, it is not clear whether racial preferences are more likely to promote tolerance or foster racial or group cleavage. n22 More important for present purposes, given the variety of racially neutral means available to the modern university to promote tolerance and emphatic understanding of differing ideas and experiences, reliance on race and ethnicity to promote this objective does not exhibit the element of necessity, of overriding justification, required of a "compelling" justification that comports with equal protection. "Strict scrutiny," the Court in Adarand made clear, is not "'strict in theory, but fatal in fact,'" 500 U.S. at 237. But neither can it be "strict in theory, but feeble in fact." To survive strict scrutiny, governments "must show that they had to do something and had no alternative to what they did," n23 for "the Fourteenth Amendment requires us to look with suspicion on the excessive use of racial considerations by the government." Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 995  [*27]  (1996) (O'Connor, J., concurring). Such a showing respondents have not made (and likely cannot make). n24 

n22 Although this litigation should be decided on the basis of constitutional principles, not empirical judgments, some studies suggest that "diversity is most likely to impede group functioning." Katherine Y. Williams & Charles A. O'Reilly, III, Demography & Diversity in Organizations: A Review of 40 Years of Research, 20 RES IN ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAV. 77, 120 (1998), quoted in Sanford Levinson, Diversity, 2 J. CONSTIT. L. 529, 550 & n.76 (2000). 

n23 Wittmer v. Peters, 87 F.3d 916, 918 (7th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 117 S.Ct. 949 (1997) (Posner, J.). 

n24 There is also a fatal under-inclusiveness to the University of Michigan's focus on selected minority groups. See 137 F.Supp. 2d at 851-52; Grutter Pet. App. 249a-51a; also note 9, supra. As the Court observed in Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 546-47 (1993): "Where government restricts only conduct protected by the First Amendment and fails to enact feasible measures to restrict other conduct producing substantial harm or alleged harm of the same sort, the interest given in justification of the restriction is not compelling." The same skepticism should apply also as a matter of equal protection. 

The University's group-representation rationale is likely what animates preferential admissions policies in the nation's "elite" institutions of higher learning. n25 One may question the underlying empirical assumption that, in the absence of racial preferences, there would be a significantly diminished representation of blacks or other minorities in particular professions. This is due in part to the fact that racial preferences are not likely to enlarge appreciably, if at all, the overall supply of qualified minority applications to the nation's universities, but, rather, distribute that supply in favor of the more selective institutions. 

n25 See, e.g., Sandalow, supra, 97 MICH. L. REV. at 1911 ("the presence of other members of their race in selective colleges and universities and in the positions to which graduation from those institutions leads may, for many, offer meaningful assurance that blacks are valued members of American society--that they have become, or at least have a realistic prospect of becoming, full participants in American life."). 

In any event, the use of race and ethnicity simply to ensure a desired racial and ethnic representation plainly fails "strict scrutiny" review, as this Court has made clear in Croson, Adarand, and Voting Rights Act cases like Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900 (1995). "At the same time that we combat the symptoms of racial polarization in politics" or society at large, "we must strive to eliminate unnecessary race-based  [*28]  state action that appears to endorse the disease." Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. at 993 (O'Connor, J., concurring). 

The University of Michigan is, of course, not tied to any particular admissions criteria. As long as it acts in race-neutral manner, and consistent with its pedagogic mission, it can alter its emphasis on aptitude test scores and grade point averages in any way it sees fit. The University also may act to modify criteria that are shown, on an appropriate record, to poorly predict success in college. Cf. Albermarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 435-36 (1975) (discussing concept of "differential validation" in employment testing context). 

But that is not what respondents seek to accomplish here. They wish to retain their emphasis on particular combinations of aptitude test scores and grade point averages, but to vary downward the standard for applicants from preferred minority groups--the University's LSA by awarding an automatic 20 points to "qualified" minorities, the Law School through its pursuit of a "critical mass" of desired minority students. The short answer, as Justice Douglas recognized, dissenting in DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312, 342-43 (1974), is that:
  
"The State . . . may not proceed by racial classification to force strict population equivalencies for every group in every occupation, overriding individual preferences. The Equal Protection Clause commands the elimination of racial barriers, not their creation in order to satisfy our theory as to how society ought to be organized. The purpose of the University of Washington cannot be to produce black lawyers for blacks, Polish lawyers for Poles, Jewish lawyers for Jews, Irish lawyers for Irish. It should be to produce good lawyers for Americans . . . . A segregated admissions process creates suggestions of stigma and caste no less than a segregated classroom, and in the end it may produce that result despite its contrary intentions."  [*29] 
If the University of Michigan's preferential admissions policies are upheld on the basis of the justifications it has offered, such reasoning can readily be employed to "'justify' race-based decisionmaking essentially limitless in scope and duration." Croson, 488 U.S. at 495 (opinion of O'Connor, J., for the plurality). 

III. NO LEGITIMATE RELIANCE INTEREST PRIVILEGES THE UNIVERSITY'S POST-1995 USE OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC PREFERENCES. 

Respondents and their amici are likely to argue that they have legitimately relied on this Court's Bakke ruling, and that respect for their settled expectations since 1978 should inform this Court's constitutional ruling. To put this contention in proper perspective, it should be noted that the instant cases do not involve class actions, and the claims of the individual plaintiffs go no further back than Jennifer Gratz's 1995 application for admission to the University's LSA. See 122 F.Supp. 2d at 814; Gratz Pet. Supp. 5a. 

Respondents' reliance claim lacks merit for several reasons. 

First, as previously noted, Justice Powell's discussion of the diversity rationale in Bakke reflected the views of only one member of the Court; and his discussion of the "Harvard Plan" was not a holding necessary to resolve the merits of the "reserved places" or "set aside" plan struck down in that case. 

Second, as we have attempted to show in Part I above, the University of Michigan's use of racial and ethnic preferences exceeds, by a good margin, the limited consideration of race as part of a truly individualized assessment of the merits of applicants envisioned in Justice Powell's opinion. Hence, Justice Powell's view provides no warrant for respondents' aggressive use of race, as evidenced by the University LSA's automatic conferral of 20 (out of 150 points) to applicants  [*30]  from preferred minority groups and the Law School's pursuit of a "critical mass" of students from such groups amounting to 10-17 percent of each entering class. 

Third, respondents, and other state universities employing similar preferential admissions programs, have been put on notice at least since the Court's June 12, 1995 ruling in Adarand that all government classifications based on race would receive "strict scrutiny" review, and that under this Court's prior rulings in Wygant and Croson nonremedial use of racial classifications would likely trigger an especially heavy burden of justification. 

Fourth, the permissible use of race and ethnicity in public university admissions decisions has been heavily contested in the lower courts, resulting in rulings of unconstitutionality by the Fifth Circuit in Hopwood v. Texas, 78 F.3d 932, cert. denied, 518 U.S. 1033 (1996), and Eleventh Circuit in Johnson v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Georgia, 263 F.2d 1234 (2001). 

In sum, respondents can offer no sound basis for arguing that they should not be held accountable for admissions decisions made in 1995 and thereafter. Absent a controlling decision of this Court, respondents certainly had every right to litigate their view of allowable constitutional limits on the use of race and ethnicity in admissions decisions. But like all litigants, they cannot avoid appropriate remedial consequences when their position is not sustained in the courts. 

CONCLUSION 

For the foregoing reasons, the decisions of the district court in Gratz and of the court of appeals in Grutter should be reversed.
