## About

**quanteda*** is an R package for managing and analyzing text, created and maintained by [Kenneth Benoit](https://kenbenoit.net) and [Kohei Watanabe](https://blog.koheiw.net/).  Its creation was funded by the European Research Council grant ERC-2011-StG 283794-QUANTESS and its continued development is supported by the [Quanteda Initiative CIC](https://quanteda.org).

For more details, see https://quanteda.io.

## **quanteda** version 4

The **quanteda** 4.0 is a major release that improves functionality and performance and further improves function consistency by removing previously deprecated functions.  It also includes significant new tokeniser rules that makes the default tokeniser smarter than ever before, with new Unicode and ICU-compliant rules that enable it to work more consistently with even more languages.

We describe more fully these significant changes in:
* an [article about the new external pointer tokens objects](https://quanteda.io/articles/pkgdown/tokens_xptr.html);
* an [article showing performance benchmarks](https://quanteda.io/articles/pkgdown/benchmarks_xptr.html) for the new external pointer tokens objects, as well as some of the tokeniser improvements in v4; and
* the [changelog for v4](https://github.com/quanteda/quanteda/blob/master/NEWS.md#quanteda-40) a full listing of the changes, improvements, and deprecations in v4.

## The **quanteda** family of packages

We completed the trend of splitting **quanteda** into modular packages with the release of v3.  The quanteda family of packages includes the following:

- **quanteda**: contains all of the core natural language processing and textual data management functions
- **quanteda.textmodels**: contains all of the text models and supporting functions, namely the `textmodel_*()` functions.  This was split from the main package with the v2 release
- **quanteda.textstats**: statistics for textual data, namely the `textstat_*()` functions, split with the v3 release
- **quanteda.textplots**: plots for textual data, namely the `textplot_*()` functions, split with the v3 release

We are working on additional package releases, available in the meantime from our GitHub pages:

- **quanteda.sentiment**: Functions and lexicons for sentiment analysis using dictionaries
- **quanteda.tidy**: Extensions for manipulating document variables in core **quanteda** objects using your favourite **tidyverse** functions

and more to come.

## How To...

### Install

The normal way from CRAN, using your R GUI or 
```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("quanteda") 
```

Or for the latest development version:
```{r eval = FALSE}
# remotes package required to install quanteda from Github 
remotes::install_github("quanteda/quanteda") 
```

Because this compiles some C++ and Fortran source code, you will need to have installed the appropriate compilers to build the development version.

### Use

See the [quick start guide](https://quanteda.io/articles/pkgdown/quickstart.html) to learn how to use **quanteda**.
