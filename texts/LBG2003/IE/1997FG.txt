FINE GAEL MANIFESTO 1997

SECURING AND SHARING OUR PROSPERITY

THIS PUBLICATION IS OUR FIRST OF A SERIES OF STATEMENTS OF FINE 
GAEL'S POLICY PRIORITIES TO BE RELEASED THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN. 
THESE STATEMENTS ARE FINE GAEL'S CORE ELEMENTS OF A PROGRAMME 
TO SECURE OUT NATION'S PROSPERITY AND SHARE IT FAIRLY FOR THE BENEFIT 
OF ALL OUR CITIZENS.

THE TASKS AND THE CHALLENGES WHICH CONFRONT THE MILLENNIUM 
GOVERNMENT ARE OUTLINED. WE THEN ADDRESS THE REQUIREMENTS FOR 
CONTINUED PROSPERITY IN TERMS OF KEY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE-SECTOR 
POLICIES TO COPE WITH AND OVERCOME THE FUTURE CHALLENGES. THERE 
IS A FOCUS ON ELEMENTS NECESSARY FOR A CONTINUATION OF SOUND 
MANAGEMENT OF THE PUBLIC FINANCES INCLUDING THE KEY INGREDIENTS 
OF RADICAL TAX REFORM. FINALLY, WE OUTLINE SPECIFIC TARGETED 
MEASURES TO AGGRESSIVELY TACKLE UNEMPLOYMENT, ESPECIALLY LONG-
TERM UNEMPLOYMENT.

TASKS FOR THE MILLENIUM GOVERNMENT

OBJECTIVES FOR THE MILLENIUM GOVERNMENT

THE ECONOMY IS WORKING WELL BUT WE CLEARLY HAVE A FURTHER ROAD 
TO TRAVEL. FINE GAEL'S OBJECTIVES FOR IRISH SOCIETY, AS WE LOOK TO 
THE DAWN OF THE NEW MILLENIUM, ARE

TO CONSOLIDATE OUR HIGH GROWTH AND LOW INFLATION PERFORMANCE 
OF RECENT YEARS THROUGH PROMOTING COMPETITIVE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE 
ENTERPRISE, SOUND PUBLIC FINANCES AND CONTINUED TAX REFORM AND 
REDUCTIONS.

TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME; ESPECIALLY DRUG-RELATED 
CRIME, AND ATTACKS ON THE ELDERLY AND ON WOMEN.

TO SUPPORT FAMILIES IN THEIR CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN, THEIR ELDERLY 
AND THEIR INCAPACITATED MEMBERS, IN A WAY THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF 
THE PRESSURES ON FAMILY STRUCTURES.

TO SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE LONG TERM UNEMPLOYMENT, ESPECIALLY ITS 
PERSISTENCE OVER TIME AND FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT IN 
SOME FAMILIES.

TO PROMOTE GREATER ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND TO DEEPEN THE QUALITY 
OF ITS DELIVERY AT ALL LEVELS.

TO STOP ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION, AND START THE PROCESS OF 
RENEWING THE ENVIRONMENT

TO WORK FOR A LASTING RECONCILIATION AN PEACE IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND, AND FOR AN END TO SECTARIANISM, INTIMIDATION AND 
TRIUMPALISM EMANATING FROM EITHER SIDE OF THE TRADITIONAL DIVIDE.

OUR ABILITY AS A NATION  TO MAKE PROGRESS TOWARDS ACHIEVING MOST 
OF THESE OBJECTIVES DEPENDS ON OUR SUCCESS IN CONSOLIDATING AND 
ENHANCING THE ECONOMIC PROSPERITY WE'VE ENJOYED IN THE LAST FEW 
YEARS. MEASURES TO SECURE THIS PROSPERITY AND THUS TO PERMIT A 
FAIR SHARING OF THE GAINS ARISING ARE SET OUT IN THIS STATEMENT.

OUR TARGETS TO SECURE PROSPERITY FOR THE NEXT 5 YEARS ARE TO:

SEE OUR ECONOMY GROW BY AT LEAST 5% EACH YEAR. IF THAT HAPPENS, 
WITHIN 15 YEARS THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE GOODS AND SERVICES IRELAND 
PRODUCES WILL HAVE DOUBLED . 

KEEP INFLATION BELOW 2% PER ANNUM. 

ACHIEVE MORTGAGE AND OTHER INTEREST RATES OF NO MORE THAN 5% - 
6% FROM 1999 ONWARDS. 

INCREASE THE TOTAL NUMBER AT WORK IN IRELAND BY AT LEAST 35,000 - 
40,000 EACH YEAR 

SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE OVERALL RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE 
RATE OF LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT CONSISTENT WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT'S TEN-YEAR TARGETS . 

 THE CHALLENGES AHEAD (BACK TO TOP)

BUT WE CANNOT TAKE THE CONTINUATION OF THIS PROSPERITY FOR 
GRANTED. IT WILL HAVE TO BE ACHIEVED IN THE FACE OF SEVERAL 
POSSIBLE CHALLENGES:

ENTRY TO EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION. 

A POSSIBLE REDUCTION IN STRUCTURAL FUNDS AFTER 1999. 

ENLARGEMENT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION TO THE EAST TO INCLUDE UP TO 
TEN ADDITIONAL COUNTRIES. 

A NEW WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION AGREEMENT, FURTHER TRADE 
LIBERALISATION AND GLOBALISATION OF THE ECONOMY. 

THE EMERGENCE OF BLOCKAGES TO PROSPERITY, SUCH AS CONGESTION IN 
THE EMPLOYMENT MARKET AS SOME SKILLS BECOME SCARCER, THE NEED 
FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO ENSURE THE 
AVAILABILITY OF QUALITY HOUSING AT AFFORDABLE PRICES. 

 

PARTNERSHIP 2000, SOCIAL INCLUSION AND EQUALITY (BACK TO TOP)

PARTNERSHIP 2000 GIVES US THE CONFIDENCE TO PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. 
AN UNPRECEDENTED WIDE GOUP OF PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN ITS 
NEGOTIATION. THIS AGREEMENT SETS OUT THE FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE 
PROGRESS ACROSS A RANGE OF POLICIES FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND 
MANY OF OUR STRATEGIES FOR THE FUTURE ARE INFORMED BY THIS 
AGREEMENT. AS A MEMBER OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT AGREED 
PARTNERSHIP 2000 WE ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO DELIVER IT.

WE REITERATE IN PARTICULAR OUR COMMITMENT TO SEE PRACTICAL EFFECT 
GIVEN TO THE PLEDGES IN PARTNERSHIP 2000 TO ACCELERATE THE PROCESS 
OF SOCIAL INCLUSION THROUGH THE VEHICLE OF THE RECENTLY 
INAUGURATED NATIONAL ANTI-POVERTY STRATEGY. THE PROMOTION OF 
EQUALITY OF TREATMENT FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS WHICH HAVE 
NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN ACCORDED THE RIGHTS DUE TO CITIZENS OF THIS 
STATE IS ALSO A KEY THEME OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ONE WHICH FINE 
GAEL FULLY SUPPORTS AS BEING CONSISTENT WITH ITS STEADFAST 
ENDEAVOURS TO PROMOTE A "JUST SOCIETY".

 

FINE GAEL'S COMMITMENT TO THE FUTURE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
(BACK TO TOP)

 

CHALLENGES AHEAD

THE GOVERNMENT WHICH DISTINGUISHED ITSELF DURING THE RECENT EU 
PRESIDENCY CAN VALIDLY CLAIM TO HAVE THE BEST CREDENTIALS TO 
OVERCOME THE FOLLOWING POSSIBLE CHALLENGES IN THE NEXT FIVE 
YEARS:

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION. 

STRUCTURAL FUNDS AFTER 1999. 

THE ENLARGEMENT AND DEEPENING OF THE UNION. 

 EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION (BACK TO TOP)

WE BELIEVE THE TIME FOR DEBATING WHETHER TO JOIN THE SINGLE 
CURRENCY WITHOU THE UK'S PARTICIPATION HAS NOW PAST. THE 
DEBATE MUST NOW SHIFT TO HOW BEST WE CAN EXTRACT MAXIMUM 
ADVANTAGE FOR THIS COUNTRY FROM INVOLVEMENT IN THE SINGLE 
CURRENCY AND IN PARTICULAR HOW TO CHART THE CORRECT POLICY COUSE 
IN THE EVENT OF THE UK NOT JOINING IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE SINGLE 
CURRENCY.

A RECENT STUDY BY THE ESRI HAS SHOWN THAT IRELAND WILL BENEFIT 
FROM JOINING THE SINGLE CURRENCY, EVEN WITHOUT THE UK, ON ANY 
REASONABLE APPRAISAL OF THE RISKS INVOLVED. THE MAIN BENEFITS 
WILL BE IN TERMS OF RELATIVE PRICE AND EXCHANGE RATE STABILITY AND 
OF COURSE LOW INTEREST RATES. THESE BENEFITS WILL ENSURE THAT WE 
CONTINUE TO REMAIN HIGHLY ATTRACTIVE TO INTERNATIONALLY MOBILE 
INVESTMENT, WHICH HAS BEEN ONE OF THE FOUNDATION STONES FOR THE 
HUGE ADVANCES WE'VE MADE IN EMPLOYMENT CREATION IN RECENT 
YEARS.

BUT THERE IS NO ROOM FOR COMPLACENCY. BY JOINING THE SINGLE 
CURRENCY, WE WILL BE GIVING UP FOR GOOD THE FREEDOM TO ADJUST 
OUR EXCHANGE RATE AS WE SEE FIT. WE THUS FACE THE POTENTIAL RISK OF 
STERLING VOLATILITY. 

ACTION ACROSS A NUMBER OF FRONTS CAN INSURE EMPLOYMENT IN 
IRELAND AGAINST THIS RISK:

A CONTINUED EMPHASIS ON SOUND, PUBLIC FINANCES, AND, IN 
PARTICULAR, ON REDUCTIONS IN TAX BURDENS FOR WORKERS AND 
ENTERPRISE. THIS WILL PROVIDE OUR TRADING SECTORS WITH GREATER 
ROOM TO RESPOND TO COMPETITIVENESS' SHOCKS IF THEY ARISE. 

FURTHER EMPHASIS ON DEVELOPING AN EDUCATED AND TRAINED 
WORKFORCE, WITH GLOBALLY TRADABLE SKILLS. WE THEREFORE PLACE AN 
ESPECIAL EMPHASIS ON INVESTING IN HUMAN CAPITAL, ESPECIALLY 
THROUGH THE ACQUISITION OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE AND COMPUTER SKILLS.

ACTIVE ENCOURAGEMENT OF MARKET DIVERSIFICATION. FORBAIRT, THE 
IDA AND AN BORD TRACHTALA (ABT) WILL BE REQUIRED TO PROPOSE 
SCHEMES TO ENCOURAGE THE NECESSARY MARKETING AND RE-TRAINING 
INVESTMENT TO FACILITATE SUCH DIVERSIFICATION. 

BUILDING ON FINE GAEL-INSPIRED INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE MORE 
FLEXIBLE SYSTEMS OF WAGE AND SALARY COMPENSATION,WE WANT 
THESE ISSUES TO BE PLACED AT THE CENTRE OF NEGOTIATIONS ON A 
SUCCESSOR TO PARTNERSHIP 2000. IN THIS RESPECT, MEASURES TO 
IMPROVE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS AT FIRM 
LEVEL,AS STRESSED IN PARTNERSHIP 2000, ARE OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE. 

STRUCTURAL FUNDS (BACK TO TOP)

IRELAND HAS BEEN THE SUCCESS STORY OF THE EU STRUCTURAL FUNDS. 
THE CLAIMS OF OTHER POORER MEMBER STATES AND THE PROSPECT OF 
NEW MEMBER STATES REQUIRES THAT GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO 
CONSTRUCT A ROBUST CASE TO RETAIN THE STRUCTURAL FUNDS AFTER 1999 
AT THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE LEVEL. FINE GAEL'S POSITION IS SIMPLE. 
IRELAND SHOULD NOT BE PENALISED BECAUSE OF OUR RECENT SUCCESS.

FINE GAEL IN GOVERNMENT BE SEEKING SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING FOR THE 
WHOLE COUNTRY. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL ARGUMENTS 
WHICH JUSTIFY THIS POSITION. FIRST, IRELAND CONTINUES TO HAVE AN 
EXCEPTIONAL LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM DESPITE SIGNIFICANT 
RECENT IMPROVEMENT. SECOND, WE HAVE FURTHER INVESTMENT 
REQUIREMENTS FOR PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE IN RELATION TO ROADS, WATER 
AND WASTE MANAGEMENT, OUR PORTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS. 
THIRD, THE STRUCTURAL FUNDS ELIGIBILITY CRITERION IS BASED ON GDP 
WHICH IN IRELAND'S CASE CONSIDERABLY EXCEEDS GNP BECAUSE OF 
OUR HIGH LEVEL OF PROFIT REPATRIATIONS. FOURTH, WHILE THE FLAWED 
GDP PER CAPITA MEASURE PUSHES US INTO THE VULNERABLE ZONE AS 
FAR AS MAXIMISING OUR ENTITLEMENT TO STRUCTURAL FUNDS, OUR "CATCH 
UP" HAS BEEN FAIRLY RECENT. FINALLY, ANY SIZEABLE AND PRECIPITOUS 
REDUCTION IN THE LEVEL OF STRUCTURAL FUNDS AFTER 1999 COULD UNDO 
THE REAL CONVERGENCE GAINS WHICH THE CURRENT FUNDING HAS 
ACHIEVED.

EU ENLARGEMENT AND DEEPENING OF THE UNION  (BACK TO TOP)

THE POSSIBILITY OF A UNION OF UP TO 25 MEMBERS BRINGS BOTH 
OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS. THE PROSPECT OF A SINGLE MARKET WITH 
AN ADDITIONAL 100 MILLION PEOPLE PROMISES OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL 
EXISTING MEMBERS AND PROVIDES FURTHER ASSURANCE FOR CONTINUING 
PEACE AND STABILITY IN EUROPE. FOLLOWING OUR SUCCESSFUL 
PRESIDENCY OF THE EU, IRELAND'S ROLE AT THE CENTRE OF EUROPE IS 
NOW ASSURED. FINE GAEL WILL PROTECT IRELAND'S VITAL NATIONAL 
INTERESTS WHERE REPRESENTATION ON THE COMMISSION AND VOTING 
RIGHTS ARE CONCERNED. THE BIGGEST THREAT TO OUR ECONOMIC 
INTERESTS, HOWEVER, WILL EMERGE IN RELATION TO AGRICULTURAL 
POLICIES.

CAP REFORM WILL BE DRIVEN BY THE CONTINUATION OF THE MACSHARRY 
REFORMS, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMITMENTS GIVEN BY THE EU IN 
THE LAST INTERNATIONAL TRADE AGREEMENT AND ANY NEW ONES WHICH 
MAY EMERGE FROM THE ROUND WHICH WILL COMMENCE IN 1999. 
FINE GAEL REITERATES THE COMMITMENTS GIVEN IN PARTNERSHIP 2000 
TO ENSURE "... THAT ANY CHANGE TO EU POLICY IS ACHIEVED IN A 
MANNER WHICH PROTECTS THE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OF IRELAND'S 
FARMING AND RURAL COMMUNITIES AND THE FOOD INDUSTRY". FINE 
GAEL WILL OPPOSE ANY ATTEMPT TO RE-NATIONALISE THE CAP. 

IN THE LIGHT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S AGENDA 2000 
PROPOSALS, WE CALL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A 
TEN-YEAR PLAN FOR IRISH FOOD AND FARMING WHICH WILL ENABLE 
IRELAND TO BECOME A COMPETITIVE WORLD-CLASS FOOD PRODUCER.

 

SECURING PROSPERITY THROUGH PROMOTING COMPETITIVE PUBLIC 
AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISE (BACK TO TOP)

MAINTAINING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

OUR RECENT PROSPERITY, IN TERMS OF HIGH GROWTH, LOW INFLATION AND 
RECORD EMPLOYMENT CREATION, HAS BEEN BASED ON THE ACHIEVEMENT 
AND MAINTENANCE OF INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS. IN THE SHORT TO 
MEDIUM TERM, DOMESTIC WAGE RATES, EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES 
ARE CRUCIAL TO KEEPING OUR COMPETITIVE EDGE. CONSTANT 
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PRODUCTIVITY OF ALL OUR RESOURCES ARE, 
HOWEVER, CRITICAL IN THE MEDIUM TO LONG TERM AS THEY ARE THE 
FOUNDATION FOR ENDURING GAINS IN OUR PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY. 

FINE GAEL WANTS TO SEE IRELAND ATTAIN A PERMANENT PLACE IN THE 
"TOP 10" LEAGUE OF INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS. THAT WILL 
REQUIRE ACTION ON SEVERAL FRONTS. PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF THE 
PUBLIC FINANCES, AND ESPECIALLY THE ULTIMATE ELIMINATION OF THE 
EXCHEQUER DEFICIT OVER THE ECONOMIC CYCLE IS A NECESSARY 
CONDITION FOR ENSURING COMPETITIVENESS ALONG WITH SUCCESSFUL 
ADHERENCE TO THE DISCIPLINES OF MONETARY UNION AFTER 1999. BUT 
IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT. SUSTAINED COMPETITIVENESS REQUIRES EVERY 
SECTOR OF OUR ECONOMY, BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE, TO BE CONSTANTLY 
ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS OF INNOVATION. 

FINE GAEL BELIEVES INNOVATION NEEDS:

INVESTMENT IN "HUMAN CAPITAL", THAT IS, EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF 
PEOPLE AND IN "KNOWLEDGE CAPITAL", THAT IS, R&D. 

INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INFRASTRUCTURE, E.G., TRANSPORT, 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS, WATER AND SEWERAGE SERVICES AND 

INSTITUTIONAL FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTABILITY IN THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC 
SECTORS TO EMBRACE CHANGE. 

FINE GAEL BELIEVES THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A TOP-LEVEL NATIONAL 
COMPETITIVENESS COUNCIL REPORTING TO AN TAOISEACH, TO DEVELOP, 
MONITOR AND PROPOSE ACTIONS FOR A PRO-COMPETITIVENESS AGENDA 
EMBRACING THE ROLE OF R&D, TRAINING, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 
SHOULD BE AN IMPORTANT NATIONAL INITIATIVE TO ACHIEVE OUR 
COMPETITIVENESS AGENDA AND ATTAIN OUR PLACE IN THE TOP-TEN LEAGUE 
OF INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS.

IRELAND'S RECENT GROWTH AND EMPLOYMENT PERFORMANCE CAN TO A 
SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE BE ATTRIBUTED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN "HUMAN 
CAPITAL" WHICH IS NOW REALLY BEGINNING TO BEAR FRUIT. "HUMAN 
CAPITAL" INVESTMENT REPAYS DIVIDENDS THROUGH HIGHER EARNINGS FOR 
MORE EDUCATED AND TRAINED PERSONS THAN FOR THOSE WITH POORER 
LEVELS. IT ALSO PERMITS COMPLEMENTARY INVESTMENT IN PHYSICAL 
CAPITAL AND R&D. THE MOST OBVIOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS PROCESS IS 
THE INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI). 
THERE IS THUS A DOUBLE PROSPERITY DIVIDEND FROM INVESTMENT IN 
"HUMAN CAPITAL". AN ENHANCED COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION AND 
TRAINING WILL BE ONE OF OUR PRINCIPAL OBSESSIONS OVER THE NEXT 
FIVE YEARS.

INVESTMENT BY THE STATE COMPLEMENTED BY EU STRUCTURAL AND 
COHESION FUNDS HAS RESULTED IN TREMENDOUS IMPROVEMENT IN THE 
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ENTERPRISE IN RECENT YEARS. BUT ALSO OF 
IMPORTANCE HAS BEEN THE UNLEASHING OF COMPETITIVE FORCES IN 
MANY STATE UTILITIES WHICH PROVIDE VITALLY IMPORTANT SERVICES TO 
THE ENTERPRISE SECTOR. FINE GAEL WILL CONTINUE TO PROMOTE BOTH OF 
THESE AREAS AS A MEANS TO IMPROVING OUR COMPETITIVENESS RANKING 
OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.

THE INFORMATION SOCIETY  (BACK TO TOP)

BRINGING THE INFORMATION SOCIETY TO OUR SCHOOLS 

DUE TO THE QUALITY OF OUR YOUNG EDUCATED LABOUR FORCE WE ARE 
UNIQUELY PLACED TO HARNESS THE GREAT POTENTIAL OF THE SO-CALLED 
"INFORMATION SOCIETY". WE ENVISAGE OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION IN SEVERAL FIELDS INCLUDING SOFTWARE, 
EDUCATION, RETAIL, FINANCIAL AND CONSULTING SERVICES. AN 
AWARENESS OF THE POTENTIAL OF THIS TECHNOLOGY MUST BE QUICKLY 
INSTILLED IN INDUSTRY, ESPECIALLY SMALL INDUSTRY. FINE GAEL 
BELIEVES WE SHOULD ASSIGN A PRIORITY TO UPGRADING KNOWLEDGE OF 
THE "INFORMATION SOCIETY" IN OUR SCHOOLS. 

ESTABLISH A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN RTE AND OTHER INTERESTS TO 
DEVELOP DIGITAL BROADCASTING. 

DIGITAL BROADCASTING TECHNOLOGY WILL NOT ONLY ENHANCE PICTURE 
AND SOUND QUALITY, BUT WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CHANNELS 
AVAILABLE FOR TELEVISION AND OTHER INFORMATION AND DATA 
TRANSMISSION SERVICES.

THE PUBLIC INTEREST REQUIRES THE PROTECTION AND ENHANCEMENT OF 
IRELAND'S NATIONAL PUBLIC SERVICE BROADCASTING NETWORK IN THESE 
CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES. FINE GAEL WILL SUPPORT A JOINT VENTURE 
BETWEEN RTE AND OTHER INTERESTS TO INVEST IN, AND DEVELOP, 
DIGITAL BROADCASTING WHICH WILL GREATLY IMPROVE THE RANGE OF OUR 
POTENTIAL TELEVISION SERVICES, INCLUDING EDUCATIONAL, CULTURAL AND 
COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES. THE ADDITIONAL CHANNELS MADE 
AVAILABLE BY DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY WILL ALSO BE A MAJOR INPUT INTO 
IRELAND'S PROGRAMME OF DEVELOPMENTS TO EXPLOIT THE INFORMATION 
SOCIETY IN THE NEW MILLENNIUM.

INTRODUCE REGULATION OF DECODERS 

FINE GAEL SUPPORTS THE INTRODUCTION OF A SYSTEM OF REGULATION OF 
DECODERS FOR DIGITAL BROADCAST RECEPTION WHICH WILL ENSURE 
UNIVERSAL AND PRIMARY ACCESS TO THE NATIONAL BROADCASTERS, 
SAFEGUARDING IRISH NATIONAL INTERESTS. 

PROTECTING NATIONAL SPORTING EVENTS 

THE TELEVISING, FREE OF CHARGE, OF KEY SPORTING AND CULTURAL 
EVENTS SHOULD BE SAFEGUARDED, IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST, BY LAW.

  
PRIORITISING INFRASTRUCTURAL INVESTMENT  (BACK TO TOP)

ESTABLISH AN INSTITUTE FOR TRANSPORT AND LOGISTICS 

INVESTMENT SHOULD BE PRIORITISED IN THE BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH 
AS ROADS, SEA PORTS, RAIL AND AIRPORTS, TRANSPORT SERVICES, AND 
PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF "SYSTEM LOGISTICS". FINE GAEL SUPPORTS 
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INSTITUTE FOR TRANSPORT AND LOGISTICS AT A 
SUITABLE THIRD-LEVEL INSTITUTION TO PROVIDE DEGREE AND DIPLOMA 
AWARDS AND TO ACT AS A RESEARCH RESOURCE FOR WHAT HAS BEEN AN 
UNDERDEVELOPED ASPECT OF OUR TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE. 

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES WILL ASSUME A CENTRAL ROLE DURING THE LIFE OF 
THE NEXT GOVERNMENT. THE INTERESTS OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND 
ENTERPRISE ARE VERY MUCH IN HARMONY. THE PURSUIT OF SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT ENSURES THAT ENTERPRISE IS CONSCIOUS THAT ITS 
ACTIVITIES TODAY WILL NOT UNDERMINE ITS CAPACITY TO REAP PROFITS IN 
THE FUTURE. OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEVELOPING NEW MARKETS FOR GOODS 
AND SERVICES MUST ALSO BE CREATED. WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO 
EXPLOIT THESE IN IRELAND. AT THE SAME TIME FINE GAEL IS CONCERNED 
THAT THE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT ON INDUSTRY BE 
MINIMISED. WE FAVOUR THE ADVANCE DESIGNATION, FOLLOWING 
EXTENSIVE LOCAL CONSULTATION, OF SUITABLE SITES FOR INDUSTRIAL 
DEVELOPMENT AND THE PRIOR CLEARANCE OF THESE SITES FOR 
DEVELOPMENT ON ENVIRONMENTAL GROUNDS.
  

INNOVATION AND CHANGE IN OUR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS  
(BACK TO TOP)

THE RESPONSES OF OUR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS TO THE 
DEMANDS OF CHANGE ALSO AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVENESS. OUR 
EDUCATIONAL AND TRAINING INSTITUTIONS MUST BE RESPONSIVE TO THE 
CHANGING REQUIREMENTS OF ENTERPRISE. OUR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT 
AGENCIES SHOULD BE ALERT TO THE EXPLOITATION OF "EARLY MOVER" 
OPPORTUNITIES IN ALL SECTORS AND IN THE PROVISION OF RELEVANT 
INFORMATION FOR AND ASSISTANCE TO ENTERPRISE. OUR COMPETITION AND 
REGULATORY AGENCIES MUST MAINTAIN A CONSTANT VIGILANCE AGAINST 
ANTI-COMPETITIVE PRACTICES IN BOTH THE STATE AND PRIVATE SECTORS. 
ALL OUR STATE SERVICES MUST STRIVE TO PROVIDE THE BEST-QUALITY 
SERVICE AT THE LOWEST PRICE, WHERE RELEVANT, TO ITS CUSTOMERS. AT 
THE SAME TIME THE BURDENS IMPOSED BY COMPLIANCE HAVE TO BE 
MINIMISED. IN SHORT, FINE GAEL SEEKS TO IMPOSE THE SAME 
DISCIPLINES ON PUBLIC BODIES AS THE MARKETPLACE PLACES ON THE 
PRIVATE SECTOR.

COMPETITION AND REGULATION 

EFFECTIVE COMPETITION MEANS BETTER AND CHEAPER GOODS AND 
SERVICES FOR HOUSEHOLDS AND BUSINESSES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FULL 
POWERS AND RESOURCES OF THE COMPETITION AUTHORITY SHOULD BE 
USED TO PROMOTE COMPETITION IN THE ECONOMY AND TO UNCOVER AND 
ERADICATE IMPERFECTLY COMPETITIVE TRADING ACTIVITY, INCLUDING 
WITHIN THE STATE AND SEMI-STATE SECTOR.

AS THE COMMERCIAL SEMI-STATE SECTOR IS UNDERGOING 
UNPRECEDENTED CHANGE AND THE TRADITIONAL MONOPOLISTIC MARKET 
STRUCTURES ARE BEGINNING TO BE REPLACED, THERE IS CLEARLY A NEED TO 
PUT IN PLACE EFFECTIVE INDEPENDENT REGULATION OF THESE SECTORS. 
WITHOUT EFFECTIVE REGULATION OF IMPERFECT COMPETITION, THE 
CONSUMER WON'T FULLY BENEFIT FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF MUCH-
NEEDED OUTSIDE CAPITAL INTO PUBLIC ENTERPRISES. IN GOVERNMENT 
FINE GAEL STARTED THIS PROCESS WITH THE APPOINTMENT OF AN 
INDEPENDENT REGULATOR FOR THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS' SECTOR. FINE 
GAEL WANTS TO SEE THIS PROCESS CONTINUED WITH THE OTHER PUBLIC 
UTILITIES. IN TIME WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE TRADING COMPANIES AND 
SECTORS OPERATE IN CLOSE TO COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS SUBJECT TO 
RIGOROUS INDEPENDENT REGULATION WHERE APPROPRIATE. 

INNOVATION IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT  
(BACK TO
TOP)

WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF STRUCTURAL FUNDS FROM EUROPE AND BACKED 
UP BY NATIONAL INVESTMENT, FINE GAEL HAVE CHAMPIONED THE 
RENEWAL OF COMMUNITIES THROUGH PROMOTING "BOTTOM UP" LOCAL 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. WE DEVELOPED INNOVATIVE PROGRAMMES, 
WHICH ARE BEING EMULATED IN OTHER COUNTRIES, THROUGH SCHEMES, 
SUCH AS URBAN RENEWAL, AREA DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT, 
COUNTY ENTERPRISE BOARDS AND LEADER WHICH DELIVER 
INVESTMENT INTO COMMUNITIES OVER WHICH LOCAL PEOPLE HAVE 
CONTROL AS TO HOW ITS SPENT. 

WE CHAMPIONED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WEST OF IRELAND THROUGH 
THE APPOINTMENT OF THE FIRST EVER MINISTER OF STATE FOR WESTERN 
DEVELOPMENT AND CREATION OF THE WESTERN DEVELOPMENT 
COMMISSION WITH A FUNDING FACILITY OF £25 MILLION. WE TOOK 
SPECIFIC STEPS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF ISLAND LIFE THROUGH 
ADDITIONAL SPENDING IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF ISLAND INFRASTRUCTURE 
OF PIERS, AIRSTRIPS, DREDGING WORKS, ROADS ETC. THE RAINBOW 
GOVERNMENT ACTIVELY PROMOTED RURAL RESETTLEMENT AS AN OPTION 
FOR URBAN-BASED FAMILIES WHO WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO EXPERIENCE 
THE QUALITY OF LIFE WHICH RURAL LIVING OFFERS.

OUR COMMITMENT TO DISTRIBUTING THE BENEFITS OF A BUOYANT 
ECONOMY ON A WIDESPREAD GEOGRAPHICAL BASIS WAS UNDERLINED BY 
THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO PAY HIGHER RATES OF 
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT GRANTS FOR MAJOR COMMERCIAL INVESTMENT 
OUTSIDE OF THE MAIN CENTRES OF POPULATION. 

IN ADDITION FINE GAEL SUPPORTS THE CONTINUED PROVISION OF 
INDUSTRIAL FINANCIAL INCENTIVES BIASED IN FAVOUR OF SMALLER 
REGIONAL LOCATIONS, WITH HIGHER GRANT LEVELS AS APPROPRIATE TO EACH 
INDIVIDUAL CASE. THIS ALSO INCLUDES THE INVOLVEMENT OF PRIVATE 
SECTOR INVESTORS TO STIMULATE AND SUPPORT A MAJOR PROGRAMME OF 
MODERN ADVANCE FACTORY CONSTRUCTION AT KEY LOCATIONS AND 
WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO HAVE AVAILABLE 
QUALITY-SERVICED SITES AT PRIORITY LOCATIONS FOR NEW INDUSTRIAL 
INVESTMENT.

FINE GAEL IS COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING THRIVING TOWN, VILLAGE AND 
RURAL COMMUNITIES. FINE GAEL BELIEVES THAT PRO-ACTIVE RURAL/LOCAL 
COMMUNITY-LED INITIATIVES, FULLY SUPPORTED BY GOVERNMENT, MUST 
BE DEVELOPED TO MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE THEIR QUALITY AND ECONOMIC 
LIFE. FINE GAEL IS COMMITTED TO ENABLING COMMUNITIES IN 
DISADVANTAGED AREAS TO SHARE IN THE NATION'S PROSPERITY.

THE VIGOROUS IMPLEMENTATION OF BETTER STANDARDS OF SERVICE TO THE 
PUBLIC AND VALUE FOR MONEY WILL BE ASSURED BY OUR COMMITMENT 
TO IMPLEMENTING "BETTER LOCAL GOVERNMENT" AS ANNOUNCED BY 
THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT IN DECEMBER 1996. THE CHANGES 
OUTLINED WILL BRING BENEFITS IN THE FORM OF GIVING LOCAL PEOPLE A 
GREATER SAY IN DECISIONS MADE BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES (LAS) WHICH 
INTIMATELY AFFECT THEIR LIVES. 

TO ACHIEVE THESE BENEFITS THE FOLLOWING INITIATIVES SHOULD BE 
IMPLEMENTED:

ENHANCE THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO THE PUBLIC 
WHICH THEY SERVE, ESPECIALLY THROUGH PROVIDING USER-FRIENDLY AND 
EASILY ACCESSIBLE INFORMATION ON KEY ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS PLANNING. 

LOCAL REPRESENTATIVES SHOULD BE GIVEN POLICY FORMULATION AND 
OVER-SEEING ROLES IN A CABINET-STYLE LOCAL ADMINISTRATION. 

LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATIONS SHOULD BE GIVEN A GREATER ROLE 
IN DECISION-MAKING BY LAS. 

IN THE LONGER TERM FINE GAEL IS COMMITTED TO TRANSFERRING 
FUNCTIONS AND ULTIMATELY POWERS, WHICH ARE AT PRESENT 
ADMINISTERED CENTRALLY, TO THE LAS. 

DELIVERING BETTER PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION  (BACK TO TOP)

WE SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE 
MANAGEMENT ACT WHICH SHOULD BE A PIVOTAL VEHICLE FOR ACHIEVING 
REAL CHANGE IN THE DELIVERY OF PUBLIC SERVICES.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS ACT WILL RESULT IN REAL AND TANGIBLE 
BENEFITS FOR ALL. FIRST, IT WILL RESULT IN MORE BEING ACHIEVED FOR 
LESS RESOURCES, AND THE CONSEQUENT RELEASE OF SAVINGS TO BE USED 
TO IMPROVE SERVICES IN PRIORITY AREAS SUCH AS HEALTH, EDUCATION 
AND FIGHTING CRIME. SECOND, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PUBLIC 
SERVICE MANAGEMENT BILL WILL ENSURE THAT BETTER QUALITY SERVICES 
WHICH ARE MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THE PUBLIC ARE PUT IN 
PLACE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE BELIEVE PUBLIC OFFICES SHOULD BE OPEN FOR 
LONGER HOURS AND DURING LUNCH TIMES. WE WANT TO SEE PUBLIC 
OFFICES TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE IN DEALING WITH THE PUBLIC. THIRD, 
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, PUBLIC SERVANTS WILL HAVE MORE 
RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE SERVICES THEY DELIVER. 

PUBLIC HOSPITAL BOARDS 

WE WILL ESTABLISH BOARDS FOR ALL OUR PUBLIC HOSPITALS WITH 
MEMBERSHIP DRAWN FROM ALL RELEVANT PARTNERS INVOLVED IN THE 
HEALTH SECTOR. 

PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS (BACK TO TOP)

PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS ALSO PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN UNDERPINNING OUR 
COMPETITIVE ECONOMY, ESPECIALLY THOSE INSTITUTIONS WHICH ASSIST 
IN THE FUNDING OF INVESTMENT. GOOD, "SAFE" IDEAS WILL NEVER BE 
SHORT OF FUNDING BUT THERE EXIST DIFFICULTIES FOR INNOVATIVE 
PROJECTS. THE DEVELOPING COMPANIES MARKET ON THE STOCK 
EXCHANGE SHOULD BE ACTIVELY ENCOURAGED. AS FINE GAEL HAS DONE 
IN THE RECENT PAST, WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT STATE INVOLVEMENT 
IN LOW-COST LONG-TERM LOAN SCHEMES WHICH ARE TARGETED TOWARDS 
SMALL SCALE HIGH-GROWTH POTENTIAL INVESTMENTS, WHERE 
MANAGEMENT ADVICE AND SUPPORT ARE PART OF THE OVERALL SUPPORT 
PACKAGE. THE £60 MILLION PROVISION FOR VENTURE CAPITAL FOR SMALL 
START-UP COMPANIES HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL AND FINE GAEL 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT BEING EXPANDED. WE BELIEVE THAT ACTIVE WAYS 
OF INVOLVING THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN GREATER EQUITY PROVISION FOR 
SMALL COMPANIES SHOULD ALSO BE EXPLORED. PENSION FUNDS ARE A 
POTENTIAL SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR LONG-TERM INVESTMENT PROJECTS IN 
BOTH THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS WHICH FINE GAEL WILL AIM TO 
EXPLOIT IN A NEW GOVERNMENT

SOCIAL PARTNERSHIP HAS BEEN AN UNDOUBTED CONTRIBUTORY FACTOR TO 
OUR RECENT PROSPERITY. THE VARIOUS NATIONAL AGREEMENTS HAVE 
DELIVERED MODERATE WAGE SETTLEMENTS AND OVERALL PEACEFUL 
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. THE MOST RECENT AGREEMENT BROADENED THE 
SCOPE OF THE PARTNERSHIP CONSIDERABLY AND PROVIDES A BETTER BASIS 
FOR A FAIR SHARING OF THE GAINS FROM MATERIAL PROGRESS. THIS 
FRAMEWORK MUST BE CALLED ON TO PLAY A PROMINENT ROLE IN THE 
REFORM OF OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS WHICH IS UNDERWAY AT PRESENT. IT 
WILL ALSO BE OF PIVOTAL IMPORTANCE IN ENSURING THAT OUR TRADING 
SECTORS ADAPT SUCCESSFULLY TO THE CHALLENGES OF MONETARY UNION. 
IN THIS CONTEXT THE EXTENSION OF THE PARTNERSHIP MODEL WHICH HAS 
CLEARLY WORKED AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL TO THE LEVEL OF THE "SHOP 
FLOOR" WILL DETERMINE TO A LARGE EXTENT WHETHER WE CAN RISE TO THAT 
CHALLENGE. FINE GAEL SUPPORTS EVERY EFFORT TO DEEPEN SOCIAL 
PARTNERSHIP IN THIS WAY. 

COMPETITIVENESS IN OUR KEY ECONOMIC SECTORS  (BACK TO TOP)

TAXATION ON PAYE WORKERS AND ENTERPRISE AFFECTS THE LEVEL OF 
PROFITS WHICH ARE AVAILABLE FOR RE-INVESTMENT IN ENTERPRISES. FINE 
GAEL IS DETERMINED TO SEE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE TAXATION 
BURDENS CONSISTENT WITH FAIRNESS, ENHANCEMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICES 
AND ACHIEVING A DEFICIT CLOSE TO BALANCE OVER THE ECONOMIC CYCLE. 
THIS IS A KEY STRATEGY TO DELIVER COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. OUR 
POLICIES ARE DEVELOPED IN FULL IN A LATER SECTION AND HERE WE 
OUTLINE SPECIFIC SECTORAL PRIORITIES.

AGRICULTURE, FOOD AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT  (BACK TO TOP)

FINE GAEL IN GOVERNMENT WILL NEGOTIATE THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT 
OF IRELAND'S AGRICULTURE AND FOOD POLICY ON THE FOLLOWING GUIDING 
PRINCIPLES:

 1.WE ARE COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT ANY CHANGE TO EU POLICY 
IS ACHIEVED IN A MANNER WHICH PROTECTS THE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OF 
IRELAND'S FARMING AND RURAL COMMUNITIES AND THE FOOD INDUSTRY. 
1.RECOGNISING THE IMPORTANCE OF AGRICULTURE AND FOOD TO THE 
NATIONAL ECONOMY, WE ARE ADAMANT THAT : 

ANY REDUCTIONS IN AGRICULTURE PRICES WILL BE COMPENSATED 
THROUGH DIRECT INCOME SUPPORT PAYMENT ;

THE PRINCIPLE OF COMMON FINANCING OF THE CAP BE FULLY 
RESPECTED ;

THE EU FINANCIAL RESOURCES NECESSARY FOR THE CONTINUED 
IMPLEMENTATION OF UNION POLICIES IN THE EXISTING MEMBER STATES, 
AS WELL AS IN THE NEW MEMBER STATES, MUST CONTINUE TO BE 
PROVIDED ;

QUOTAS AND SIMILAR PRODUCTION RIGHTS MUST BE PROTECTED, SUBJECT 
TO IRELAND MAINTAINING OUR STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE IN GRASS-BASED 
PRODUCTION, SO AS TO ENSURE THAT NATIONAL PRODUCTION CAPACITY IS 
NOT REDUCED ;

AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF COMMUNITY PREFERENCE MUST BE PRESERVED.

PARTNERSHIP 2000 CONTAINS A NUMBER OF KEY PLEDGES TO PROTECT THE 
LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OF IRELAND'S PRIORITIES IN FARMING, FOOD AND 
RURAL DEVELOPMENT. WE ARE COMMITTED TO SEEING THAT THESE 
UNDERTAKINGS ARE FULLY DELIVERED. THERE ARE, HOWEVER, A NUMBER 
OF ADDITIONAL POLICY INITIATIVES WHICH WE WILL INTRODUCE TO 
UNDERPIN THE COMPETITIVE BASIS OF RURAL SOCIETY.

ESTABLISH A FOOD SAFETY AUTHORITY 

SINCE MARCH OF 1996,THE WORLD'S BEEF MARKETS HAVE BEEN 
CONVULSED BY THE FALLOUT FROM THE HUMAN HEALTH SCARES EVOKED BY 
BSE. WE HAVE TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN BEEF PRODUCTS AMONG 
CONSUMERS AT HOME AND ABROAD. WE NEED A BOLD MEASURE TO DO 
THIS, NOT JUST FOR BEEF BUT ALL FOODS. WE THEREFORE PROPOSE TO 
BUILD ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A FOOD SAFETY BOARD AND WORK 
TOWARDS THE INSTITUTION OF A NEW AND INDEPENDENT STATUTORY 
REGULATORY AUTHORITY - THE FOOD SAFETY AUTHORITY - WITH A BRIEF TO 
REGULATE ALL FOOD AND RELATED PRODUCTS WHICH MAY INDIRECTLY OR 
DIRECTLY IMPACT ON HUMAN HEALTH. THIS AUTHORITY WOULD EXECUTE 
LICENSING, LABELLING, MONITORING AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS. FOR THE 
OFFICE TO FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY IT WILL THUS REQUIRE ALL INSPECTORATE 
AND TECHNICAL STAFF TO BE BROUGHT UNDER ITS DIRECT CONTROL AND 
HENCE REDEPLOYED TO IT FROM ALL RELEVANT DEPARTMENTS. THIS 
INITIATIVE REQUIRES EXTENSIVE CONSULTATION IN ORDER TO BE 
IMPLEMENTED SUCCESSFULLY. THE AUTHORITY WOULD OPERATE UNDER 
THE AEGIS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH.

ESTABLISH AN OFFICE OF MINISTER FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT 

FINE GAEL RECOGNISES THAT RURAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY IS A FUNCTION 
OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, FOOD AND FORESTRY AND TO THIS 
END WE ARE COMMITTED TO ESTABLISHING AN OFFICE OF MINISTER FOR 
RURAL DEVELOPMENT, CONSOLIDATING AND CO-ORDINATING ALL POLICY 
FORMULATION FOR THE FUTURE IN THIS REGARD.

PUBLISH A WHITE PAPER ON RURAL DEVELOPMENT 

FINE GAEL WILL PUBLISH A WHITE PAPER ON RURAL DEVELOPMENT 
WHICH WILL ADDRESS THE INTEGRATION OF ALL ASPECTS OF RURAL 
DEVELOPMENT. PARTICULAR EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON THE FINDINGS 
OF THE RECENT `CORK DECLARATION' OF NOVEMBER 1996.

FARMERS WOULD BENEFIT, LIKE OTHER TAXPAYERS, FROM OUR PROPOSED 
TAX-REFORM PROGRAMME. 

AS A RESULT OF A FINE GAEL-INSPIRED INITIATIVE, CORPORATION TAX 
WAS REDUCED TO ONLY 28% FOR SMALL COMPANIES - A DECLINE OF 
12% IN THREE BUDGETS. THIS REGIME ENCOURAGES RE-INVESTMENT IN 
THE BUSINESS WHICH IS THE LIFELINE TO A COMPETITIVE FUTURE. WE 
BELIEVE, GIVEN THIS REDUCED TAX RATE AND OUR INITIATIVE TO SEE THE 
RATE FALL TO 12.5%, FARMERS WILL CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL GAINS FROM 
INCORPORATING THEIR BUSINESSES. FINE GAEL WILL ACTIVELY EXPLORE ALL 
THE COMPLEX ISSUES INVOLVED IN FACILITATING THIS OPTION.

THE FORESTRY SECTOR (BACK TO TOP)

THE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR FORESTRY, PUBLISHED BY FINE GAEL IN 
GOVERNMENT, AIMS TO DOUBLE THE LEVEL OF AFFORESTATION LEADING TO 
11,000 ADDITIONAL JOBS. FINE GAEL BELIEVES THAT THIS INCREASE IN 
AFFORESTATION MUST TAKE PLACE IN HARMONY WITH THE ENVIRONMENT 
AND WITH CONVENTIONAL FARMING. WE WILL ALSO, THROUGH URGENT 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE EU, ENSURE THAT THE CURRENT DISPARITY WHICH 
EXISTS BETWEEN SUPPORTS FOR CONVENTIONAL FARMING AND FORESTRY IS 
REMOVED.

TOURISM  (BACK TO TOP)

TOURISM IS ONE OF OUR BIGGEST INDUSTRIES AND IT IS IMPORTANT FOR 
US TO CONTINUE SETTING NEW AIMS AND OBJECTIVES. WE PLEDGE TO:

INCREASE FOREIGN TOURISM REVENUE, KEEPING PERFORMANCE AHEAD OF 
TARGETS SET IN THE SIX-YEAR OPERATIONAL PROGRAMME. 

CONTINUE TO SUPPORT NATIONWIDE CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN OUR TOURISM 
INFRASTRUCTURE. 

BUILD ON THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL AND INNOVATIVE PROGRAMMES SUCH 
AS THE SEASIDE RESORT SCHEME, THE PROMOTION OF OUR INLAND 
WATERWAYS, RECREATIONAL, CULTURAL AND HERITAGE-DRIVEN TOURISM. 

BEGIN PLANNING TO OPTIMISE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE SECTOR IN THE 
CONTEXT OF THE NEW ROUND OF STRUCTURAL FUNDS. 

BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION  (BACK TO TOP)

THE IRISH CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE WITH 
CONSTRUCTION COSTS LOWER THAN THE EU AVERAGE. IRISH CONSTRUCTION 
GOODS' EXPORTS TOTALLED £360 MILLION AND IMPORTS TOTALLED £580 
MILLION IN 1992. THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IS A KEY INDUSTRIAL 
SECTOR UNDERPINNING ECONOMIC GROWTH, INFRASTRUCTURAL SUPPORT 
AND EMPLOYMENT IN IRELAND. FINE GAEL WOULD ENSURE THAT 
GOVERNMENT CONTRIBUTES TO A HEALTHY DEMAND IN THE CONSTRUCTION 
INDUSTRY BY MAINTAINING A POSITIVE CLIMATE FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH 
AND FIXED INVESTMENT. GOVERNMENT MUST PLAN FOR THE POSSIBILITY 
OF REVISED EU FUNDING FOR CONSTRUCTION INVESTMENT POST-1999 
AND PROCEED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITH THE PLANNED ASSESSMENT OF 
THE SCOPE FOR PRIVATE FINANCE PROCUREMENT AS PROPOSED IN 
PARTNERSHIP 2000. FINE GAEL WILL SUPPORT THE OBJECTIVES AND 
APPORPRIATE RECOMMENDATIONS EXPECTED SHORTLY IN THE STRATEGIC 
REVIEW OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY :

AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY OF THE SECTOR; 

TO PROMOTE THE COMPETITIVENESS OF IRISH INDUSTRY IN THE DOMESTIC 
AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS ; 

TO SECURE, AS FAR AS PRACTICABLE, REASONABLE STABILITY IN 
CONSTRUCTION DEMAND ; 

TO ENSURE FAIR, TRANSPARENT AND EFFICIENT PROCEDURES INCLUDING 
COMPETITIVE TENDERING IN CONSTRUCTION, IN ACCORDANCE WITH EU 
PUBLIC PROCUREMENT DIRECTIVES ; 

TO REDUCE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE PARTNERS TO THE CONSTRUCTION 
PROCESS AND REDUCE THE COSTS OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION ; 

TO SECURE A REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT WHICH WILL PROMOTE QUALITY 
AND SAFETY IN BUILDING DESIGN CONSTRUCTION BY THE MOST COST-
EFFICIENT MEANS ; 

FINE GAEL ARE COMMITTED IN GOVERNMENT TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF 
APPROPRIATE DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS IN SUPPORT OF THESE 
OBJECTIVES WITHIN ONE YEAR OF TAKING OFFICE.

THE MARINE (BACK TO TOP)

OUR CENTRAL AIM FOR THE MARINE SECTOR IS TO ENSURE THAT THE COUNTRY 
BENEFITS TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE, CONSISTENT WITH THE 
REQUIREMENTS OF SAFETY, SUSTAINABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION, FROM ITS MARINE NATURAL RESOURCES AND MARINE INDUSTRY 
AND SERVICES. ACHIEVEMENT OF THE SECTOR'S FULL POTENTIAL WILL BE OF 
PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE FOR COASTAL COMMUNITIES.

SECTORAL ANALYSES POINT TO SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL DEMAND FOR A WIDE 
RANGE OF MARINE PRODUCTS WHICH HAS NICHE POTENTIAL TO EXPLOIT. 
THE HIGH QUALITY OF OUR ENVIRONMENT AND THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE 
COASTAL ZONE ALSO OFFER SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL. 
GROWTH ESTIMATES FOR THE MARINE FOOD, MARINE TOURISM AND 
LEISURE AND MARINE TECHNOLOGY SECTORS ALONE PROJECT INCREASES IN 
THE ORDER OF 50% IN TURNOVER AND 20% IN JOBS BY 2008.

DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES FOR THE SECTOR MUST BE CONSISTENT WITH 
SUSTAINABILITY PRINCIPLES. IN PARTICULAR, LONG-TERM PRESERVATION 
AND IMPROVEMENT OF FISH STOCKS, THROUGH CAREFUL MANAGEMENT 
AND RESPONSIBLE FISHING, IS VITAL FOR THE FUTURE OF THE FISHING 
INDUSTRY. STRATEGIES FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THE MARINE SECTOR MUST, 
THEREFORE, BE PURSUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIGH STANDARDS OF 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. 

FINE GAEL'S PRIORITIES FOR THE SECTOR INCLUDE:

THE ONGOING PROGRAMMES OF INVESTMENT SUPPORTED BY THE 
OPERATION PROGRAMME FOR FISHERIES 

THE FORMULATION, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE INDUSTRY, OF A STRONG 
CASE FOR A MORE EQUITABLE SHARE OF AVAILABLE FISH RESOURCES UNDER 
THE COMMON FISHERIES POLICY. 

THE EXPLOITATION OF IRELAND'S NATURAL ADVANTAGES FOR FURTHER 
GROWTH OF THE AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY. 

THE CREATION OF A STRONG PROCESSING SECTOR CHARACTERISED BY 
SPECIALISATION AND HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS. 

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR INLAND SALMON 
FISHING WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF CONSERVING, MANAGING AND 
DEVELOPING THE WILD SALMON RESOURCE ON A SUSTAINABLE BASIS 

THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STRATEGY FOR REALISING THE POTENTIAL FOR 
GROWTH IN MARINE TOURISM AND LEISURE 

TO REDUCE THE COST PENALTY OF IRELAND'S PERIPHERAL LOCATION AT THE 
EDGE OF MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS, BY SUPPORTING AND FACILITATING 
THE AVAILABILITY OF EFFICIENT AND COMPETITIVE SHIPPING AND PORT 
SERVICES. 

THE PROMOTION OF SAFETY AWARENESS AND THE EFFECTIVE APPLICATION 
OF SAFETY RULES AND REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE THAT MARINE 
EMERGENCIES AND ACCIDENTS ARE PREVENTED. 

SMALL BUSINESS AND SERVICES  (BACK TO TOP)

  
FINE GAEL IN GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED SMALL BUSINESS AND SERVICE 
COMPANIES IN A MANNER NOT PREVIOUSLY DONE BY ANY GOVERNMENT. 
IN ADDITION TO INCLUDING, FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE REPRESENTATIVES OF 
SMALL BUSINESS IN PARTNERSHIP 2000 TALKS, FINE GAEL AGREED 
SPECIFIC SUPPORT MEASURES TO UNDERPIN THESE ENTERPRISES. SPECIFIC 
MEASURES ACHIEVED FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND SERVICE COMPANIES, 
INCLUDED:

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A £208M., 7 YEAR, 6.5% FIXED INTEREST RATE 
LOAN SCHEME. 

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A £60M. SEED AND VENTURE CAPITAL FUND 
FOR SMALL MANUFACTURING COMPANIES. 

THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW 28% CORPORATION TAX ON FIRST 
£50,000 OF PROFITS FOR NON-MANUFACTURING COMPANIES. 

THE REDUCTION OF OVERALL CORPORATION TAXES FROM 40% TO 36%. 

THE REDUCTION OF EMPLOYER'S PRSI - TWO-THIRDS OF ALL JOBS WERE 
MADE SUBJECT TO A LOW RATE OF 8.5% (BEFORE THE RAINBOW 
GOVERNMENT ALL JOBS WERE SUBJECT TO OVER 12%). 

THE CREATION OF ONE-STOP-SHOPS FOR SMALL BUSINESS THROUGH THE 
ENTERPRISE LINK, AND THE COUNTY ENTERPRISE BOARDS. 

THE INTRODUCTION OF A PROMPT PAYMENTS BILL WHICH REQUIRES ALL 
PUBLIC BODIES TO PAY THEIR BILLS ON TIME. 

THE INCLUSION OF SERVICE COMPANIES TO ACCESS STATE SUPPORTS AND 
THE PUBLICATION OF A GOVERNMENT STRATEGY PAPER ON SERVICES. 

TO SUSTAIN THE GROWTH OF SMALL BUSINESS AND SERVICE COMPANIES 
AND THE HISTORIC INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF WORKERS EMPLOYED BY 
THESE BUSINESSES, FINE GAEL IS COMMITTED TO THE CONTINUATION OF 
THIS VITAL SUPPORT. THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC MEASURES SHOULD BE 
IMPLEMENTED: 

A REDUCTION IN CORPORATION TAX TO 12.5% FOR ALL COMPANIES. 

THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW LOW INTEREST, LONG-TERM LOAN FINANCE 
PACKAGE FOR 7 AND 10 YEAR PERIODS. 

THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL STRATEGY TO EASE THE ADMINISTRATIVE 
BURDEN, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT CODES OF PRACTICE FOR 
DEPARTMENTS, AND SMALL BUSINESS PROOFING FOR ALL LEGISLATION. 

THE ARTS  (BACK TO TOP)

THIS GOVERNMENT CHAMPIONED A NEW VISION FOR THE ARTS IN 
IRELAND. IN ADDITION TO SUPPORTING THE FILM AND MUSIC INDUSTRIES, 
WITH A VIEW TO INCREASING EMPLOYMENT, THIS GOVERNMENT ADOPTED 
A BROADER VISION TO PROMOTE OUR NATIONAL CULTURE AND HERITAGE. 
THIS VISION WAS GIVEN PRACTICAL EXPRESSION IN THE ARTS PLAN SET 
OUT BY THE ARTS COUNCIL.

FINE GAEL IS DETERMINED TO SEE THE CONTINUATION OF THE 
DEVELOPMENT AND ENHANCEMENT OF IRELAND'S RICH AND DIVERSE 
CULTURAL INHERITANCE BY DEVELOPING, IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND 
NATIONALLY, A GREATER AWARENESS OF THIS INHERITANCE AND A WIDER 
PARTICIPATION IN THE ARTISTIC LIFE OF OUR COUNTRY. IN A NEW 
GOVERNMENT FINE GAEL WILL REVIEW AND PROPOSE SPECIFIC ACTIONS 
TO SUPPORT CULTURALLY-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AS WELL 
IMPORTANT NEW TOURIST ATTRACTIONS AND STRATEGICALLY-SITED HERITAGE 
CENTRES AND MUSEUMS.

FINE GAEL IN GOVERNMENT WILL PROMOTE EDUCATION IN THE ARTS AS 
AN INTEGRAL ELEMENT OF LIFELONG LEARNING.

SOUND MANAGEMENT OF THE PUBLIC FINANCES IN THE ERA OF 
MONETARY UNION  (BACK TO TOP)

BUDGETARY FRAMEWORK 1997-2002

THE PROSPERITY WHICH IS POSSIBLE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS - UP TO 
5% ANNUAL GROWTH IN REAL GNP - HOLDS OUT THE PROSPECT FOR 
DELIVERING SUBSTANTIAL TAX REFORM AND REDUCTIONS, IMPROVEMENTS 
IN SERVICES, AN ASSAULT ON UNEMPLOYMENT AND A TACKLING OF THE 
PROBLEMS OF DISADVANTAGE AND EXCLUSION. FINE GAEL THUS BELIEVES 
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD SET ITSELF RIGOROUS BUT BALANCED 
BUDGETARY TARGETS FOR TAX REFORM, PUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND 
REDUCTIONS IN BORROWING. BUT IT MUST ALSO BE QUITE EXPLICIT ABOUT 
THE PROCESS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THE TARGETS SET, ESPECIALLY AS 
REGARDS PUBLIC EXPENDITURE.

PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE MEANS THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT MUST RECOGNISE THAT THERE SEVERE LIMITS TO THE SCOPE 
FOR NEW SPENDING PROGRAMMES. THE BUDGETARY FRAMEWORK MUST 
BE DESIGNED IN ORDER:

TO FULFIL THE REQUIREMENTS OF EMU AND ESPECIALLY THE NECESSITY TO 
TARGET FOR THE ELIMINATION OF THE GOVERNMENT DEFICIT OVER THE 
ECONOMIC CYCLE ("STABILITY PACT"). 

TO IMPLEMENT THE TAX REFORM AND EXPENDITURE COMMITMENTS 
UNDER PARTNERSHIP 2000. 

TO CONTINUE TO DELIVER SERIOUS TAX REFORM AND REDUCTION FOR 
PAYE WORKERS TO ENSURE FAIRNESS AND TO PROMOTE EMPLOYMENT 
AND ENTERPRISE. 

TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN PUBLIC CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO UNDERPIN 
OUR PROSPERITY. 

TO RECOGNISE THAT THE LEVEL OF EU STRUCTURAL FUNDS MUST BE 
RENEGOTIATED AFTER 1999 IN THE LIGHT OF THE ACCESSION OF NEW 
MEMBERS AND THE FACT THAT IRELAND ALREADY HAS INCREASED ITS 
INCOME PER HEAD ABOVE MANY OTHER EU STATES. 

TO ENSURE ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR THE ENHANCEMENT OF PUBLIC 
SERVICES, ESPECIALLY IN THE AREAS OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, SOCIAL 
WELFARE AND IN COMBATING CRIME. 

TO MAKE ADEQUATE CONTINGENCY PROVISIONS FOR UNEXPECTED 
EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS AND FOR A POSSIBLE GROWTH OUT-TURN 
BELOW OUR EXPECTED LEVEL OF 5%. 

RECOGNISING THESE FACTORS, FINE GAEL BELIEVES THAT IN SHARING THE 
GAINS WHICH ARE POSSIBLE FOR ALL OUR CITIZENS FROM A CONTINUATION 
OF PROSPERITY, AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE SHOULD BE STRUCK BETWEEN 
TAX REFORM; IMPROVEMENTS IN SERVICES SUCH AS POLICING AND 
CRIME, HEALTH, EDUCATION, WELFARE AND OTHER PUBLIC SERVICES. THIS 
BALANCE IS A MATTER OF POLITICAL CHOICE. TO ACHIEVE THIS BALANCE 
FINE GAEL BELIEVES THE NEW GOVERNMENT SHOULD ADOPT THE 
FOLLOWING FIVE-POINT BUDGETARY FRAMEWORK OVER THE NEXT FIVE 
YEARS:

WHILST RECOGNISING THAT BORROWING IN INDIVIDUAL YEARS IS AFFECTED 
BY CYCLICAL ECNOMIC FACTORS, FINE GAEL ASSERTS THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT SHOULD ASPIRE TO ELIMINATE ALL GOVERNMENT 
BORROWING FOR CAPITAL OR CURRENT PURPOSES. THIS FACTOR WOULD 
CONDITION THE ENTIRE BUDGETARY FRAMEWORK. WITHIN THIS 
CONSTRAINT THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES SHOULD BE ADHERED TO: 

 1.A CONTINUED REDUCTION IN THE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL GOVERNMENT 
EXPENDITURE (CURRENT AND CAPITAL) RELATIVE TO GNP.
 1.THE MAINTENANCE OF THE PUBLIC CAPITAL PROGRAMME AT A LEVEL 
SUFFICIENT TO UNDERPIN OUR NATIONAL COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND 
PROSPERITY. 
 2.A TAX-REFORM AND REDUCTION PACKAGE FOR PAYE WORKERS 
WHICH BUILDS ON PARTNERSHIP 2000 AND EXTENDS THOSE 
COMMITMENTS TO REWARD WORK AND ENTERPRISE TO 2002. 
 3.THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NUMBER OF NEW PUBLIC SERVICE 
PROGRAMMMES, OVER AND ABOVE COMMITMENTS IN PARTNERSHIP 
2000 AND THE IMPROVEMENT IN EXISTING SERVICES, WILL BE ENTIRELY 
CONDITIONAL ON ACHIEVING OUR OBJECTIVES IN RELATION TO THE 
GOVERNMENT DEFICIT AND THE MAASTRICHT CRITERIA. 

 
 ACHIEVING EXPENDITURE CONTROL  (BACK TO TOP)

THE ADHERENCE TO THIS BUDGETARY FRAMEWORK IS TO A LARGE EXTENT 
CONDITIONAL ON SUCCESSFULLY CONTROLLING THE GROWTH IN PUBLIC 
EXPENDITURE. GOVERNMENT HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT 
WASTE AND FRAUD ARE ELIMINATED AND VALUE FOR MONEY (VFM) IN 
THE SUPPLY OF ALL SERVICES IS CONTINUOUSLY STRIVEN FOR, AND THAT 
SPENDING PROGRAMMES WHICH HAVE GONE PAST THEIR "SELL BY DATE" 
ARE WOUND UP.

THE IMPOSITION OF A SPENDING TARGET HELPS EXPENDITURE CONTROL. 
WE ALSO NEED TO TACKLE THE PROCESS OF DECISION-MAKING ON PUBLIC 
SPENDING USING THE BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES BORROWED FROM 
THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND FROM SUCCESSFUL APPROACHES IMPLEMENTED 
IN OTHER COUNTRIES. 

A FISCAL TRANSPARENCY ACT 

IN GOVERNMENT WE WILL BRING FORWARD A FISCAL TRANSPARENCY ACT 
WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF MAKING THE IMPLICATIONS OF GOVERNMENT 
DECISIONS TRANSPARENT TO THE PUBLIC IN TERMS OF THE FULL FUTURE 
TAXATION AND EXPENDITURE CONSEQUENCES OF ALL CURRENT DECISIONS. 
THIS LEGISLATION WILL SET OUT A SET OF BASIC PRINCIPLES AND CONTROL 
MEASURES WHICH WILL GOVERN THE CONDUCT OF DECISION-MAKING ON 
FISCAL POLICY, SUCH AS:

SETTING TARGETS FOR PUBLIC DEBT AND DEFICIT LEVELS CONSISTENT WITH 
MONETARY UNION OBJECTIVES. 

COMMITTING GOVERNMENT TO GUARANTEE A REASONABLE DEGREE OF 
STABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY OF FUTURE TAX LEVELS. 

REQUIRING GOVERNMENT TO PUBLISH MEDIUM-TERM PROJECTIONS WITH 
APPROPRIATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS (5-10 YEARS) AT EACH BUDGET OF 
THE EVOLUTION OF THE PUBLIC FINANCES CONSISTENT WITH THE BUDGET 
DECISIONS. 

COMMITTING GOVERNMENT TO PUBLISHING INFORMATION ON THE PUBLIC 
FINANCES ON THE BASIS OF COMMITTED EXPENDITURE RATHER THAN ON A 
CASH BASIS. 

REQUIRING ALL GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES TO PRODUCE 
BALANCE SHEETS OF ALL THEIR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES SO THAT BY 
ESTABLISHING THE NET WORTH OF THE STATE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS 
ON THE EFFICIENT USE OF STATE ASSETS CAN BE MADE. 

PLEDGING GOVERNMENT TO PURSUE A STRICT FINANCIAL "ENVELOPE" 
APPROACH TO MAINTAINING OVERALL SPENDING CONTROL AS OPPOSED TO 
THE TRADITIONAL "BRICK BY BRICK" SYSTEM. 

ESTABLISHING RIGOROUS PROCEDURES FOR VALUE FOR MONEY (VFM) 
EVALUATIONS OF EXPENDITURE IN ALL GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS ALONG 
THE LINES CURRENTLY EMPLOYED FOR THE STRUCTURAL FUNDS AND OTHER 
EU SPENDING. THESE EVALUATIONS WOULD COVER NOT JUST THE ENDS 
AND MEANS OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAMMES BUT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE 
IMPORTANT TASKS OF GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION WHICH HAVE 
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE LEVEL OF EXPENDITURE SUCH AS PAYMENTS BY 
THE STATE, THE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC PROCUREMENT AND CLAIMS ON 
GOVERNMENT AND LARGE PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. IN 
REGARD TO THE LATTER FINE GAEL BELIEVES THAT MORE COST EFFECTIVE 
PUBLIC INVESTMENT PROGRAMMES CAN BE DELIVERED IF A GREATER ROLE 
IS INVITED FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR. FINE GAEL WANTS TO SEE THE 
DEVELOPMENT AND PUBLICATION OF GUIDELINES TO ENCOURAGE PRIVATE 
SECTOR INVOLVEMENT IN PUBLIC INVESTMENT PROGRAMMES. ALL 
EVALUATIONS WOULD BE PUBLISHED AND SUBJECT TO VFM AUDIT. 

ESTABLISHING PRODUCTIVITY TARGETS EQUAL TO BEST PRACTICE, ON THE 
BASIS OF UNCHANGED POLICIES, BY PROGRAMME/DEPARTMENTAL 
EXPENDITURE CATEGORY. DEPARTMENTS SHOULD BE INCENTIVISED TO 
ACHIEVE PRODUCTIVITY SAVINGS BY PERMITTING UP TO 70% OF 
PRODUCTIVITY SAVINGS TO BE RETAINED FOR NEW SERVICES OR 
IMPROVEMENTS IN EXISTING SERVICES IN THOSE DEPARTMENTS WHICH 
HAVE ACHIEVED PRODUCTIVITY SAVINGS, PROVIDED THESE NEW 
EXPENDITURES ARE JUSTIFIED ON RIGOROUS VFM GROUNDS. 

REQUIRING ALL NEW SPENDING PROPOSALS SPONSORED BY INDIVIDUAL 
DEPARTMENTS TO SPECIFY HOW THE ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURE COULD BE 
FINANCED. 

FINE GAEL BELIEVES THAT, AS HAS BEEN SHOWN IN OTHER COUNTRIES, 
BY ENSHRINING THE MEASURES OUTLINED ABOVE IN LAW THERE WILL BE A 
REQUIREMENT FOR VISIBLE APPLICATION OF THE VARIOUS MEASURES. 

MANAGING OUR PUBLIC SERVICES  (BACK TO TOP)

THERE ARE OVER 200,000 PEOPLE EMPLOYED IN OUR PUBLIC SERVICES. 
THEY MAKE A VITAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE WELL BEING OF THE STATE. 
SOCIETY DEPENDS ON THE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT DELIVERY OF THESE 
SERVICES. THE STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE (SMI) IS THE MOST 
FAR-REACHING REFORM OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF 
THE STATE. SMI IS ABOUT IMPROVING EFFICIENCY BUT IT IS ALSO 
CONCERNED, AS AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF THE INITIATIVE, WITH 
IMPROVING THE WORKING CONDITIONS AND CAREER OPPORTUNITIES OF 
PUBLIC SERVANTS.

THE PUBLIC SECTOR PAY BILL ABSORBS ABOUT HALF OF TOTAL CURRENT 
SPENDING. IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE COHERENCE OF OUR BUDGETARY 
FRAMEWORK THAT THE BILL IS CONTAINED WITHIN THE TERMS OF 
PARTNERSHIP 2000, AGREED BETWEEN THE SOCIAL PARTNERS. THE SINGLE 
GREATEST SOURCE OF GROWTH IN THE PAY BILL IN RECENT YEARS HAS BEEN 
SPECIAL AWARDS. A RECURRENCE OF THESE AWARDS WOULD UNDERMINE 
THE INTEGRITY OF PARTNERSHIP 2000, REDUCE THE GOVERNMENT'S 
ABILITY TO DELIVER ITS TAX REFORM PACKAGE AND RESTRICT THE EFFICACY 
OF THE SMI PROCESS.

WITHIN THE TERMS OF PARTNERSHIP 2000 FOR PUBLIC SECTOR 
PRODUCTIVITY, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD :

SEEK SIMPLIFICATION OF THE GRADE STRUCTURE IN MANY PUBLIC 
SERVICES, SO AS TO IMPROVE FLEXIBILITY, AND MAXIMISE THE 
OPPORTUNITY FOR DELEGATION OF RESPONSIBILITY TO THE LOWEST 
EFFECTIVE LEVEL. 

SEEK CHANGES IN WORK PRACTICES THAT WILL IMPROVE THE SERVICE TO 
THE PUBLIC, E.G. BY FACILITATING OPENING OF CERTAIN OFFICES AT 
WEEKENDS OR AT TIMES WHEN THE PUBLIC CAN CALL ON THEM. 

SEEK CHANGES IN WORK PRACTICES, WHERE APPROPRIATE, THAT WILL 
REDUCE EXCESSIVE OVERTIME. 

REQUIRE THAT THE IMPROVEMENTS IN PRODUCTIVITY BE IDENTIFIED PRIOR 
TO THE PAYMENT OF THE INCREASE. 

WE ARE CONVINCED THAT SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN WORKING 
CONDITIONS CAN BE ACHIEVED FOR ALL THROUGH PRODUCTIVITY GAINS. 
PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS ENHANCE THE WORKING ENVIRONMENT. 
THEY DO NOT THREATEN IT. THE GOVERNMENT WANTS THE PUBLIC 
SERVICES TO BE A PLACE THAT WILL, IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES, BE ENJOYABLE 
TO WORK IN. CHANGES IN PRACTICES ARE NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THAT. WE 
WILL BE NEGOTIATING, WITH THE SOCIAL PARTNERS, TO ACHIEVE THIS.

MANAGING THE COMMERCIAL SEMI-STATE ASSETS  (BACK TO TOP)

FINE GAEL BELIEVES THAT THE RETURN TO THE RICH STOCK OF COMMERCIAL 
STATE-SPONSORED BODIES (CSSBS) ASSETS SHOULD BE MAXIMISED 
FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS, NAMELY, THE 
EXCHEQUER, CONSUMERS, THE WORKFORCE AND, WHERE RELEVANT, NON-
EXCHEQUER HOLDERS OF EQUITY. FINE GAEL SUPPORTS THE 
CONTINUATION OF THE "CORPORATISATION" DRIVE AMONG ALL THE 
COMMERCIAL STATE-SPONSORED BODIES (CSSBS). 
"CORPORATISATION" HAS WORKED IN COMPANIES SUCH AS TELECOM 
EIREANN, AN POST AND AER LINGUS AND MEASURES ARE PLANNED FOR 
BORD NA MONA AND AER RIANTA. "CORPORATISATION" REQUIRES ALL 
CSSBS TO ACT "AS IF" THEY WERE CORPORATES IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, 
BY REQUIRING THEM, WITHIN REASONABLE BUT STRICT TIME PERIODS, TO 
GENERATE DIVIDENDS TO THE EXCHEQUER AND COMMERCIAL RETURNS 
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT SIMILAR-SIZED COMMERCIAL ENTITIES WOULD DO, 
TAKING ACCOUNT OF PUBLIC SERVICE OBLIGATIONS AS LAID DOWN BY THE 
GOVERNMENT. 

FINE GAEL WANTS TO SEE MORE COMPANIES GIVEN THE FREEDOM TO 
PROCEED WITH STRATEGIES DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE THESE 
"CORPORATISATION" OBJECTIVES (E.G., RE-STRUCTURING; STRATEGIC 
ALLIANCES; PARTIAL PUBLIC FLOATATIONS OF SHARES ETC.) SUBJECT TO THE 
FOLLOWING KEY PROVISOS:

¥ EACH COMPANY SHOULD BE TREATED ON ITS MERITS.

¥ THE STATE SHOULD RETAIN A MAJORITY SHAREHOLDING IN CSSBS 
UNLESS IT IS SHOWN THAT THIS LEVEL OF SHAREHOLDING IS ACTUALLY 
IMPAIRING THE COMPANY'S CAPACITY TO ACHIEVE ITS PRESCRIBED 
"CORPORATISATION" OBJECTIVE, OR, WHERE THE STATE HAS NO CLEAR 
STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE IN RETAINING A MAJORITY OF THE SHARES.

¥ EMPLOYEES OF THESE COMPANIES WILL BE INVOLVED ON A GENUINE 
PARTNERSHIP BASIS IN ANY "CORPORATISATION" DRIVE AND WHERE SALE 
OF EQUITY IS CONTEMPLATED, A PERCENTAGE WILL BE SET ASIDE FOR 
ACQUISITION BY EMPLOYEES THROUGH AN EMPLOYEE SHARE 
OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP) IN RETURN FOR A REAL MONETARY 
CONSIDERATION.

¥ FINE GAEL WOULD BE WILLING TO CONSIDER SALE OF EQUITY OR A 
PUBLIC FLOTATION, AS PART OF OUR "CORPORATISATION" STRATEGY, IN THE 
CASE OF, FOR EXAMPLE, THE TSB, COILLTE, THE GREAT SOUTHERN 
HOTELS AND IFI. A PERCENTAGE OF THE EQUITY WOULD HAVE TO BE SET 
ASIDE FOR AN ESOP AND WE WOULD BE ANXIOUS THAT THE ACQUISITION 
OF SHARES SHOULD BE SPREAD AMONG THE GREATEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
POSSIBLE.

THE BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH OF "CORPORATISATION" WOULD ACCRUE 
NOT JUST TO THE STATE BUT ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY TO THOSE WORKING IN 
STATE COMPANIES. RATHER THAN HAVING THE SALARIES AND WAGES THEY 
EARN AND THE INVESTMENT DECISIONS THEY MAKE RIGOROUSLY 
CONTROLLED BY A GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT, THEY SHOULD HAVE THE 
FREEDOM TO MAKE AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY CAN ON THE BASIS OF 
ACHIEVING PROFITABLE RESULTS FROM THEIR WORK. THE WHOLE 
PROGRAMME WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN CONSULTATION WITH 
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE EMPLOYEES IN EACH FIRM. 

DELIVERING SUSTAINABLE TAX REFORMS AND REDUCTIONS  (BACK TO 
TOP)

AIMS

FINE GAEL SEEKS A TAX SYSTEM THAT "MAKES IT PAY TO MAKE A JOB 
AND TO TAKE A JOB". WE WANT A SYSTEM WHICH IS FAIRER AND 
SIMPLER. WE WANT REAL TAX REFORM AND REDUCTIONS FOR ALL WORKERS. 
WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE COMMITMENTS GIVEN IN PARTNERSHIP 
2000, WHICH COVERS THE PERIOD UP TO 1999, SHOULD BE DELIVERED 
ON AND TO CONTINUE THE THRUST OF THE AGREED TAX REDUCTIONS UP TO 
2002. 

REAL TAX REFORM AND REDUCTIONS IS ONE OF OUR PRINCIPAL 
OBSESSIONS. WE HAVE TWO KEY OBJECTIVES WHICH WE WANT OUR TAX 
SYSTEM TO ACHIEVE. FIRST, WE WANT TO SEE THE PROGRESS MADE IN 
RECENT YEARS IN REDUCING, IN A FAIR WAY, THE AMOUNT OF MONEY ALL 
TAXPAYERS PAY OUT OF THEIR PAY PACKETS,TO BE CONTINUED. SECOND, 
WE WANT OUR TAX SYSTEM TO ENCOURAGE WORK AND ENTERPRISE. 

OUR INCOME TAX SYSTEM IS COMPLEX. TAKE-HOME PAY DEPENDS ON 
TAX RATES, TAX BANDS, ALLOWANCES, LEVIES AND PRSI CONTRIBUTIONS. 
TACKLING ANY ONE OF THESE FACTORS IN ISOLATION IS NOT OF ITSELF 
SUFFICIENT TO DELIVER REAL AND FAIR TAX REDUCTIONS.

OUR VIEW IS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PAYE TAXPAYERS ARE 
PRIMARILY CONCERNED ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF INCOME TAX AND PRSI 
PAID OUT OF THEIR TOTAL PAY PACKETS. WE THUS BELIEVE THAT IN A TAX-
REDUCTION PROGRAMME PRIORITY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO REDUCING THE 
REAL TAX RATE, THAT IS, THE AMOUNT OF TOTAL INCOME TAX AND PRSI 
DEDUCTED FROM GROSS INCOME. THIS WOULD REQUIRE ACTION IN 
PARTICULAR ON TAX-FREE ALLOWANCES AND BANDS. OUR GENERAL AIM IS 
TO SEE A REDUCTION IN THE REAL TAX RATE FOR AN AVERAGE EARNER TO AT 
LEAST 22P IN THE £ FOR A SINGLE PERSON AND 14P FOR A MARRIED 
PERSON, (BEFORE TAKING ACCOUNT OF ANY DISCRETIONARY ALLOWANCES).

REDUCING THE BURDEN OF TAXES ON WORKERS

OUR PACKAGE WOULD REDUCE THE REAL TAX RATE - THE INCOME TAX 
AND PRSI TAKE EXPRESSED AS A FRACTION OF INCOME - ON THE AVERAGE 
INCOME TO ABOUT 22% FOR A SINGLE PERSON AND ABOUT 14% FOR A 
MARRIED PERSON. THIS IS THE RATE WHICH REALLY MATTERS TO 
TAXPAYERS.

THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THESE OBJECTIVES WOULD INVOLVE FIVE KEY 
COMMITMENTS:

¥ INCREASE TAX FREE ALLOWANCES

TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF ALLOWANCES TOWARDS THE PRESENT EXEMPTION 
LIMITS, THAT IS, TO INCREASE TAX FREE ALLOWANCES FROM £2,900 
(SINGLE)/£5,800 (MARRIED) TO £4,400 (SINGLE)/£8,800 (MARRIED) 
BY 2002. THIS OBJECTIVE WILL BENEFIT ALL EARNER S BUT PARTICULARLY 
MIDDLE AND LOWER INCOME WORKERS. IT WILL PROMOTE EMPLOYMENT 
CREATION. IT WILL REMOVE THE POVERTY TRAPS INHERENT IN THE PRESENT 
MARGINAL RELIEF SYSTEM.

¥ WIDEN STANDARD RATE TAX BANDS

TO WIDEN THE TAX BANDS SO THAT, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE INCREASED 
TAX ALLOWANCES, NO TAXPAYER WILL PAY TAX AT THE TOP RATE ON A 
SINGLE PENNY IF THEIR TOTAL GROSS INCOME IS LESS THAN THE AVERAGE 
INDUSTRIAL WAGE IN 2002 WHICH WE EXPECT BY THEN TO BE AROUND 
£17,000. THIS TARGET CONFRONTS THE REAL PROBLEM WITH OUR TAX 
SYSTEM WHICH IS THAT TOO MANY TAXPAYERS BEGIN PAYING TAX AT THE 
TOP RATE ON MODEST INCOMES.

¥ REDUCE EMPLOYEE PRSI

TO REDUCE THE FULL-RATE OF EMPLOYEE PRSI .

¥ CUT THE TOP RATE OF INCOME TAX

TO CUT THE TOP RATE OF INCOME TAX FROM 48% TO 45% OVER THE 
PERIOD OF GOVERNMENT; THIS AND OUR COMMITMENT ON PRSI ARE 
PART OF A REFORMING PACKAGE WHICH WOULD ADDRESS MARGINAL RATES 
OF TAXATION TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO TAKE ON EXTRA RESPONSIBILITIES 
AT WORK. 

¥ DISMANTLE HEALTH AND EMPLOYMENT LEVIES

TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF DISMANTLING THE HEALTH AND EMPLOYMENT 
LEVIES, WHICH ADD 2.25% TO THE MARGINAL TAX RATE, SHOULD BE 
INITIATED THROUGH SUBSTANTIALLY RAISING THE LIABILITY THRESHOLD FROM 
£10,250 AT PRESENT TOWARDS THE AVERAGE INDUSTRIAL WAGE BY 2002.

THESE MEASURES ARE FAIR AND BALANCED. THEY WOULD PRINCIPALLY 
BENEFIT PEOPLE ON MIDDLE TO LOW INCOMES. THEY WOULD GIVE 
SINGLE PERSONS, IN PARTICULAR, WHO ARE TAKING UP EMPLOYMENT FOR 
THE FIRST TIME A VERY REAL BREAK. THEY WOULD ALSO HELP CREATE JOBS 
BECAUSE WE KNOW LOW-INCOME EMPLOYMENT IS MORE RESPONSIVE 
TO CHANGES IN WAGE COSTS AND WAGE INCOMES THAN HIGH-INCOME 
EMPLOYMENT. AND THESE MEASURES UNDERLINE OUR BASIC 
COMMITMENT TO SHARING PROSPERITY. 

BETWEEN 1994 AND 1997, THE TAX BURDEN, FOR A SINGLE PERSON ON 
AVERAGE EARNINGS, HAS BEEN CUT BY FIVE PERCENTAGE POINTS AND BY 
FOUR POINTS FOR A MARRIED PERSON ON THE SAME INCOME. THE ACTUAL 
OVERALL TAX BURDEN ON WORKERS FELL BY ONLY THREE POINTS FOR A 
SINGLE PERSON AND BY ONLY TWO POINTS FOR A MARRIED PERSON 
BETWEEN 1989 AND 1992. 

BECAUSE OF TARGETED REDUCTIONS IN TAX BURDENS, WHICH 
PROPORTIONATELY BENEFIT MIDDLE AND LOW-INCOME TAXPAYERS MORE, 
A SINGLE WORKER ON AVERAGE EARNINGS IN 1997 HAD TO WORK THE 
BEST PART OF A MONTH LESS TO DISCHARGE HIS OR HER TAX AND PRSI 
OBLIGATIONS COMPARED WITH THE PERIOD 1989-1992.

REDUCING THE BURDEN OF ENTERPRISE TAXES  (BACK TO TOP)

¥ REDUCE CORPORATION TAX

IN THE MEDIUM TERM WE WANT TO SEE A SINGLE RATE OF CORPORATION 
TAX OF 12.5% ON ALL CORPORATIONS. ACTIONS SHOULD BE 
SIMULTANEOUSLY TAKEN TO CLAWBACK SOME OF THE WINDFALL GAINS FOR 
NON-TRADED SERVICES IN PARTICULAR, AND TO COMBAT POTENTIAL ABUSE. 
THIS DECISIVE MEASURE WOULD UNDERSCORE OUR ATTRACTIVENESS AS A 
LOCATION FOR MOBILE INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL, SUPPORT OUR INDIGENOUS 
INDUSTRY, ALLOW US TO CONTINUE OUR JOB CREATION RECORD OF ALMOST 
1,000 JOBS PER WEEK SINCE 1994 AND TO HALVE THE TOTAL 
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TO BELOW 6% AND THE LONG-TERM RATE TO 3.5% 
WITHIN THE NEXT TEN YEARS.

¥ REDUCE EMPLOYER PRSI

WE WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO REDUCE EMPLOYER PSRI BY FOCUSING 
MAINLY ON RAISING THE CEILING FOR THE 8.5% RATE.

SPECIFIC TAX REDUCTION MEASURES FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE AND YOUNG
PERSONS  (BACK TO TOP)

INCREASE INCOME TAX EXEMPTION LIMITS FOR THE ELDERLY

OVER THE TERM OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT THE INCOM-TAX EXEMPTION 
LIMITS AND ALLOWANCES FOR PENSIONERS WILL BE INCREASED IN LINE 
WITH OUR COMMITMENTS TO IMPROVE THE GENERALEXEMPTION AND 
ALLOWANCES LEVELS. FOR PERSONS AGED BETWEEN 65 AND 75 WE WILL 
SEEK TO INCREASE THE EXEMPTION LIMITS FROM £4,600 
(SINGLE)/£9,200 (MARRIED TO £5,200 (SINGLE)/£10,400 (MARRIED). 
FOR PERSONS OVER 75, THE LIMITS WILL BE RAISED FROM £5,200 
(SINGLE)/£10,400 (MARRIED TO £5,200 (SINGLE)/£11,800 (MARRIED) 

INCREASE TAX FREE-ALLOWANCES FOR THE ELDERLY

THE AGE TAX FREE ALLOWANCE FOR PERSONS OVER WILL BE INCREASED 
FROM£400 (SINGLE)/£800 (MARRIED) TO £1000 (SINGLE)/ £2000 
(MARRIED. WE L ALSO CALL FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW HIGHER AGE 
ALLOWANCE FOR THE OVER 75S. THUS IN THE NEXT BUDGET, WE WILL 
BRING FORWARD A PROPOSAL FOR AN ENHANCED AGE ALLOWANCE OF £500 
(SINGLE)/£1000 (MARRIED) FOR PERSONS AGED OVER 75. THIS 
ALLOWANCE WILL BE PROGRESSIVELY RAISED TO £1,100 (SINGLE)/ 
£2,200 (MARRIED) OVER THE NEW TERM OF GOVERNMENT.

THESE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE AGE ALLOWANCES WHEN COMBINED WITH 
OUR COMMITMENTS IN RELATION TO GENERAL ALLOWANCES WILL MEAN THAT 
THE TAX-FREE ALLOWANCE FOR PERSONS AGED BETWEEN 65 AND 75 WILL 
RISE FROM £3,300 (SINGLE)/£6,600 (MARRIED) BY 2002. FOR 
PERSONS OVER 75 YEARS OF AGE, THEIR TAX FREE ALLOWANCE WILL BE 
INCREASED FROM £3,300 (SINGLE)/£6,600 (MARRIED) TO £5,500 
(SINGLE)/£11,000 (MARRIED) BY 2002

ENHANCE TAX TREATMENT OF SURVIVING SPOUSES

FINE GAEL BELIEVES THAT ALL PERSONS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN WHO 
BECOME WIDOWED SHOULD RETAIN THE FULL MARRIED PERSON'S TAX-FREE 
ALLOWANCE AND BANDS. FOR A PERSON WITHOUT DEPENDANTS THEY 
SHOULD, RETAIN ENTITLEMENT TO THESE DEDUCTIONS FOR A TWO-YEAR 
PERIOD FOLLOWING THE YEAR OF BEREAVEMENT.

ENHANCED PRSI-FREE ALLOWANCE FOR UNDER 23S

FINE GAEL ADVOCATED SPECIAL EXEMPTIONS FROM EMPLOYERS' PRSI 
FOR EMPLOYEES AGED UNDER 23 IN THE PROGRAMME FOR THE RAINBOW 
GOVERNMENT. THIS WAS IMPLEMENTED. AS A FURTHER MEASURE TO 
EASE ENTRY INTO EMPLOYMENT WE WOULD DOUBLE THE EXISTING 
EMPLOYEE PRSI-FREE ALLOWANCE FOR ALL PEOPLE UNDER 23 YEARS OLD 
WHO ARE TAKING UP THEIR FIRST FULL-TIME JOB. THEY WOULD RETAIN THIS 
BENEFIT FOR A TWO-YEAR PERIOD. THIS MEANS THAT THE FIRST £160 OF 
WEEKLY EARNINGS WOULD BE COMPLETELY FREE OF EMPLOYEE PRSI 
DEDUCTIONS.

INCENTIVISING OCCUPATIONAL PENSIONS

ONLY 46% OF THOSE AT WORK HAVE OCCUPATIONAL PENSIONS. WITHOUT 
OCCUPATIONAL PENSIONS, THESE EMPLOYEES, ON RETIREMENT, WILL 
HAVE ONLY THE CONTRIBUTORY OLD AGE PENSION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF 
SOCIAL WELFARE TO RELY ON. WHILE THIS WILL PROVIDE FOR BASIC 
NEEDS, WE WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE MORE YOUNGER PEOPLE TO TAKE 
OUT PENSION COVER. WE WOULD THEREFORE INTRODUCE A SPECIAL 
ADDITIONAL TAX INCENTIVE FOR EMPLOYEES, UNDER THE AGE OF THIRTY 
WHO TAKE OUT AND MAINTAIN A PRIVATE PENSION SCHEME EITHER ON 
THEIR OWN OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH THEIR EMPLOYER.

A NEW SOCIAL CONTRACT WITH THE UNEMPLOYED  (BACK TO TOP)

AIMS

WE WANT TO SEE SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS IN THE LEVEL OF 
UNEMPLOYMENT AND ESPECIALLY LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT WHICH 
LIES AT THE ROOT OF POVERTY AND SOCIAL EXCLUSION OVER THE NEXT FIVE 
YEARS. FINE GAEL BELIEVES THAT THE SUCCESSFUL ACHIEVEMENT OF THIS 
OBJECTIVE WOULD COME ABOUT THROUGH THE CONTINUATION OF OUR 
ECONOMIC PROSPERITY UNDERPINNED BY THE POLICIES ADOPTED BY THIS 
GOVERNMENT.

A CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED STRATEGY IS REQUIRED BASED ON SEVERAL 
PLANKS - TAXATION, EDUCATION, WELFARE AND DIRECT EMPLOYMENT 
CREATION. WE WANT TO SEE OUR EMPLOYMENT SUPPORT AND WELFARE 
POLICIES TRANSFORMED SO THAT NO PERSON WHO BECOMES 
UNEMPLOYED IS CONDEMNED TO A PERMANENT EXISTENCE ON WELFARE. 
PERMANENT WELFARE IS DESTRUCTIVE OF THE INDIVIDUALS CONCERNED, 
AND CREATES ALIENATION FROM SOCIETY, AND ATTENDANT ILLS SUCH AS 
CRIME AND ILLICIT DRUG TAKING. IT WASTES THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT 
RESOURCE WE HAVE AS AN ECONOMY WHICH IS PEOPLE WHO ARE 
WILLING AND ABLE TO WORK. 

OUR NEW SOCIAL CONTRACT WITH THE UNEMPLOYED IS, AS SET OUT IN 
PARTNERSHIP 2000, ".....BASED ON THE RECIPROCAL OBLIGATIONS OF 
SOCIETY TO PROVIDE DECENT INCOMES AND WORTHWHILE SUPPORTS IN 
JOB SEEKING FOR THE UNEMPLOYED, AND OF THE UNEMPLOYED TO SEEK 
AND ACCEPT REASONABLE EMPLOYMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING 
OPPORTUNITIES". 

THE STATE'S OBLIGATIONS TO THE UNEMPLOYED  (BACK TO TOP)

FINE GAEL COMMITS ITSELF TO SEEKING IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SCALE 
AND QUALITY OF STATE-SPONSORED SERVICES TO THE UNEMPLOYED. THE 
RESOURCES TO FUND THIS PLEDGE ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN OUR BUDGETARY 
FRAMEWORK IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE CONSISTENT WITH PARTNERSHIP 
2000 AND WOULD BE SUPPLEMENTED BY SAVINGS ARISING FROM THE 
CONTINUED FALL IN UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND FROM THE SUCCESSFUL 
PROGRESSION OF ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES.

¥ ENSURE MINIMUM SOCIAL WELFARE PAYMENTS

FINE GAEL WANTS TO SEE THE MINIMUM RATES OF SOCIAL WELFARE 
PAYMENTS,AS RECOMMENDED BY THE COMMISSION ON SOCIAL 
WELFARE, IMPLEMENTED BY THE END OF 1999. THEREAFTER PAYMENTS 
SHOULD BE IMPROVED CONSISTENT WITH THE AVOIDANCE OF ANY LABOUR 
MARKET DISTORTIONS.

¥ MAKE WORK ATTRACTIVE

TAXATION BURDENS ON WORKERS SHOULD BE REDUCED IN SUCH A WAY 
AS TO MAXIMISE THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF WORKING AND GAINS SHOULD BE 
BIASED TOWARDS REDUCING THE BURDEN ON MIDDLE TO LOW-INCOME 
EARNERS.

¥ IMPROVE THE FAMILY INCOME SUPPLEMENT

FINE GAEL BELIEVES THE FAMILY INCOME SUPPLEMENT (FIS) IS AN 
EXCELLENT MEANS OF IMPROVING THE RETURNS FROM LOW-INCOME 
EMPLOYMENT. IT ENCOURAGES PEOPLE WITH FAMILIES TO CHOOSE WORK 
OVER WELFARE. THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE OPERATION OF FIS 
WHICH RENDER IT MUCH LESS EFFECTIVE IN THIS REGARD THAT WHAT IT 
MIGHT BE. 

FIRST, BECAUSE FIS IS WITHDRAWN AS GROSS INCOME INCREASES 
MEANS THAT THE TAKE-HOME PAY OF A WORKER ON FIS DOESN'T 
INCREASE MUCH OVER A LARGE RANGE OF MODEST INCOME LEVELS. IN 
OTHER WORDS, POVERTY TRAPS ARE CREATED. THE INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE 
ON FIS TO EARN MORE INCOME BY TAKING UP A BETTER PAID JOB OR 
WORKING OVERTIME IS REDUCED. THIS MAY ALSO DISCOURAGE SOME 
MARRIED PEOPLE, WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED FROM TAKING UP 
EMPLOYMENT. FINE GAEL CALLS FOR THE TACKLING OF THIS PARTICULAR 
DEFICIENCY IN FIS BY RELATING PAYMENTS TO NET INCOME.

THE SECOND CONCERN, IS THAT ONLY A THIRD OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD 
APPEAR TO BE ENTITLED TO FIS ARE ACTUALLY TAKING UP THE PAYMENT. 
THE REASONS FOR THIS LOW TAKE UP MAY BE INADEQUATE AWARENESS 
OR A PERCEIVED STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEASURE. STEPS NEED TO 
BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE WHO QUALIFIES GETS THE FIS. 
UNLESS THESE STEPS ARE TAKEN, THIS SCHEME WILL BE LESS EFFECTIVE IN 
INCENTIVISING WORK THAN IT MIGHT BE. THEREFORE, WE PROPOSE THAT 
THE FEASIBILITY OF HAVING THE SUPPLEMENT PAID AS A TAX CREDIT 
SHOULD BE EXAMINED, DIRECT TO THE EMPLOYEE THROUGH HIS 
EMPLOYER ON AN AUTOMATIC BASIS. THIS WOULD GET RID OF THE 
PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH LOW TAKE UP. IT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY 
INCREASE THE INCENTIVE TO WORK. IF FEASIBLE, FIS COULD BE REPLACED 
BY A REFUNDABLE WORK TAX CREDIT. THE SCHEME WOULD OPERATE 
BY CREDITING WHAT THE PERSON GETS UNDER FIS AGAINST THEIR TAX BILL. 
WHERE THERE IS NO TAX LIABILITY THE PERSON IN QUESTION WOULD 
SIMPLY GET A REFUND FROM REVENUE. 

THE TAKE-UP RATE UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION OF FIS IN THIS WAY 
SHOULD BE INCREASED BECAUSE PAYMENT WOULD BE AUTOMATIC. 

¥ ESTABLISH THE NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT SERVICE

A REVAMPED NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT SERVICE SHOULD PROVIDE A 
NATIONWIDE INTEGRATED SERVICE FOR THE UNEMPLOYED. THE SERVICE IS 
BASED ON THE SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF THE LOCAL EMPLOYMENT 
SERVICE. IT WILL OFFER UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE A PRO-ACTIVE, HIGH 
QUALITY, HIGHLY INTENSIVE, AND INDIVIDUAL-BASED JOB COUNSELLING 
AND ADVISORY SERVICE, INITIALLY, FOR THE MOST DISADVANTAGED 
GROUPS AS SET OUT IN PARTNERSHIP 2000. THE SERVICE WILL REFER 
PEOPLE TO OTHER AGENCIES FOR TRAINING, AND JOB PLACEMENT AS 
APPROPRIATE.

WE ALREADY HAVE A WIDE RANGE OF DIRECT JOB-SUPPORT PROGRAMMES 
IN PLACE WHICH ARE ACHIEVING SUCCESS, E.G., COMMUNITY 
EMPLOYMENT (CE) AND THE CONFERENCE OF RELIGIOUS OF IRELAND'S 
(CORI) SCHEMES WHICH PROVIDE DIRECT EMPLOYMENT TO OVER 
40,000 PERSONS; THE BACK TO WORK ALLOWANCE WHICH PERMITS AN 
UNEMPLOYED PERSON WHO TAKES UP A JOB OR BECOMES SELF 
EMPLOYED TO RETAIN UNEMPLOYMENT PAYMENTS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME 
AT A REDUCING LEVEL PLUS OTHER NON-CASH BENEFITS WHICH HE WOULD 
HAVE HAD WHEN UNEMPLOYED SUCH AS THE MEDICAL CARD; JOBSTART 
WHICH PROVIDES A SUBSIDY OF £80 PER WEEK FOR AN EMPLOYER TO 
TAKE ON A PERSON WHO HAS BEEN UNEMPLOYED FOR THREE YEARS OR 
MORE, ETC. THESE MEASURES WILL BE SUBJECT TO ON-GOING 
EXAMINATION AND REVIEW. WE SEE TWO WORTHWHILE SPECIFIC 
MODIFICATIONS TO THESE PROGRAMMES. 

FIRST, THE SERVICE SHOULD WORK WITH FAS TO OFFER SPECIAL SHORT 
COURSES (1-2 WEEKS) IN JOB APPLICATION/SEARCH AND 
INTERVIEW/PRESENTATION TARGETED TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
UNEMPLOYED FOR AT LEAST 12 MONTHS.

SECOND, FOR THE STATE TO CREDIBLY EXPECT THE UNEMPLOYED TO 
ACCEPT REASONABLE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IT MUST PROVIDE A 
JOB GUARANTEE. COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT, CORI AND OTHER 
MEASURES SHOULD PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THIS REGARD. THE EVIDENCE 
FROM OTHER COUNTRIES SUGGESTS THAT THE EXISTENCE OF A GUARANTEE 
LIKE WHAT WE PROPOSE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL.

THE COST OF INTRODUCING AN OPEN-ENDED GUARANTEE FOR ALL LONG-
TERM UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE WOULD BE PROHIBITIVE IN THE INITIAL YEARS 
BUT WE BELIEVE IT IS WORTH INTRODUCING THIS GUARANTEE FOR PERSONS 
UNDER 25 WHO HAVE BEEN UNEMPLOYED FOR AT LEAST A YEAR. THIS 
WOULD SERVE AS A PILOT BEFORE CONSIDERING ANY EXTENSION OF THE 
GUARANTEE TO ALL LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE.

RECIPROCAL COMMITMENT OF UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE  (BACK TO TOP) 

WHEN AN UNEMPLOYED PERSON QUALIFIES FOR UNEMPLOYMENT 
BENEFIT/ASSISTANCE, AND REGISTERS WITH THE NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT 
SERVICE, THEY SHOULD BECOME ENTITLED TO AVAIL OF, AND TAP INTO, THE 
FULL RESOURCES OF THE SERVICE.

THE NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT SERVICE SHOULD PRO-ACTIVELY WORK 
WITH EACH INDIVIDUAL CLIENT, THROUGH INTENSIVE COUNSELLING, IN 
ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND AGREE THE BEST PATHWAY TO WORK IN TERMS OF 
TRAINING, JOB PLACEMENT ETC. TAILORED TO THE INDIVIDUAL 
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE UNEMPLOYED PERSON.

IT IS THE OBLIGATION OF THE STATE TO PROVIDE WORTHWHILE 
EMPLOYMENT SUPPORTS AND OF THE UNEMPLOYED PERSON TO SEEK AND 
ACCEPT REASONABLE EMPLOYMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING 
OPPORTUNITIES.

 
FAMILY AND HEALTH

  POLICIES ON FAMILY & HEALTH 

PHILOSOPHY

FOR FINE GAEL, FAMILY AND COMMUNITY ENCAPSULATE A WAY OF LIFE 
WHICH WE VALUE HIGHLY. GROWING URBANISATION AND TECHNOLOGICAL 
CHANGE PLACE STRESS ON THE FAMILY. PURPOSEFUL GOVERNMENT 
ACTIONS CAN HELP AND ENHANCE OUR ATTACHMENT TO THE FAMILY AND 
THE WIDER COMMUNITY. 

 
SO WHAT DID WE DO IN GOVERNMENT?

 
1. STRENGTHENING FAMILIES AND CARING FOR 
CHILDREN 
(BACK TO TOP)

TAX AND SOCIAL WELFARE 

FAMILIES ARE DELIBERATELY FAVOURED IN OUR TAXATION AND SOCIAL 
WELFARE SYSTEMS. THE LAST FINE GAEL-LED GOVERNMENT PUT MORE 
FINANCIAL RESOURCES AT THE DISPOSAL OF FAMILIES THROUGH TARGETED 
TAX AND PRSI CUTS AND THROUGH THE DRAMATIC INCREASES IN CHILD 
BENEFIT. INDEED MANY OF OUR POLICIES IN AREAS SUCH AS TACKLING 
UNEMPLOYMENT, DRUG ADDICTION, AND EDUCATION, DIRECTLY 
BENEFITTED FAMILIES. 

COMMISSION ON THE FAMILY 
  
WE ESTABLISHED AN OIREACHTAS COMMITTEE ON THE FAMILY AND A 
COMMISSION ON THE FAMILY WHICH WILL ASSIST IN DEVISING 
STRATEGIES FOR THE RENEWAL AND PROTECTION OF FAMILY AS THE LIFE 
PULSE OF IRISH SOCIETY. 

FAMILY MEDIATION 
  
WE EXPANDED THE FAMILY MEDIATION SERVICES AND A SECOND CENTRE 
BEEN OPENED IN LIMERICK. WE ALSO INCREASED THREE-FOLD THE 
FUNDING OF MARRIAGE COUNSELLING SERVICES.

 
2. SUPPORTING FAMILIES IN DIFFICULTIES (BACK TO 
TOP)

FIRST MINISTER FOR CHILDREN 

  FINE GAEL IN GOVERNMENT APPOINTED THE FIRST MINISTER FOR 
CHILDREN. THE APPOINTMENT OF A MINISTER FOR STATE AT THE 
DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION, HEALTH AND JUSTICE HAS PLAYED A 
SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN DEVELOPING MUCH IMPROVED SERVICES FOR THE 
CARE OF CHILDREN. 

CABINET COMMITTEE ON CHILDREN'S SERVICES 

A CABINET COMMITTEE ON CHILDREN'S SERVICES WAS ESTABLISHED. 
THIS COMMITTEE COMPRISES THE MINISTERS FOR JUSTICE, HEALTH, 
EDUCATION, SOCIAL WELFARE AND EQUALITY AND LAW REFORM. THIS 
COMMITTEE WILL ENSURE THAT SERVICES FOR CHILDREN, BY THE STATE, ARE 
A HIGH LEVEL PRIORITY OF GOVERNMENT.

 CHILD BENEFIT 

IN GOVERNMENT, FINE GAEL INCREASED CHILD BENEFIT FOR THE FIRST 
TWO CHILDREN BY 50% AND BY 60% FOR ALL SUBSEQUENT CHILDREN. 

1995 FAMILY LAW BILL 
  
THE FAMILY LAW ACT 1995 STRENGTHENS THE LAW IN RELATION TO 
ORDERS OF THE COURT FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF SPOUSES AND CHILDREN 
FOLLOWING A JUDICIAL SEPARATION. 

CONSTITUTIONAL BAN ON DIVORCE 

  UNFORTUNATELY, MARRIAGES BREAK DOWN. FINE GAEL IN 
GOVERNMENT SET ABOUT GIVING PEOPLE A SECOND CHANCE - A CHANCE 
TO RE-MARRY. WE HELD A SUCCESSFUL CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM ON 
DIVORCE. THE 1996 FAMILY LAW (DIVORCE) ACT GAVE LEGISLATIVE 
EFFECT TO THE PEOPLE'S AMENDMENT. 

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAWS 

THE 1996 DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ACT HAS STRENGTHENED THE POWER OF 
THE COURTS TO MAKE ORDERS PROTECTING PEOPLE FROM VIOLENCE IN THE 
HOME. IT EXTENDS THAT PROTECTION TO COHABITANTS AND STRENGTHENS 
THE POWERS OF ARREST OF GARDAI TO INTERVENE IN DOMESTIC DISPUTES. 

MAINTENANCE PAYMENTS 

THE MAINTENANCE ACT WAS ADOPTED WHICH ENABLES THE UNITED 
NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE RECOVERY ABROAD OF MAINTENANCE 
PAYMENTS TO ENTER INTO FORCE BETWEEN IRELAND AND 52 OTHER 
CONTRACTING STATES. 

ADOPTIVE LEAVE 

THE 1995 ADOPTIVE LEAVE ACT PROVIDES A STATUTORY RIGHT TO 
ADOPTIVE LEAVE FOR WORKING MOTHERS AND, IN CERTAIN 
CIRCUMSTANCES, FATHERS.  

CHILD CARE ACT 

  FINE GAEL IN GOVERNMENT  FULLY IMPLEMENTED THE CHILD CARE 
ACT. THIS GREATLY STRENGTHENS THE POWERS OF THE GARDAI, HEALTH 
BOARDS AND COURTS TO INTERVENE TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM ABUSE 
AND NEGLECT. SINCE 1993, THE GOVERNMENT  APPROVED OVER 900 
ADDITIONAL STAFF TO CHILD-CARE SERVICES.

 CHILDREN'S BILL 

  THE CHILDREN'S BILL,HAS BEEN PUBLISHED AND THE MAIN 
PROVISIONS, WHEN ENACTED, WILL ENSURE THAT THE JUVENILE JUSTICE 
SYSTEM WILL BE PLACED ON A MODERN STATUTORY BASIS. IT ALSO 
ENSURES THAT PARENTAL AND FAMILY RESPONSIBILITY FOR CHILDREN IN 
TROUBLE WITH THE LAW WILL BE ACTIVELY PROMOTED THROUGH FAMILY 
CONFERENCES AND OTHER MEASURES. THE INTERNATIONAL SCOURGE OF 
CHILD PORNOGRAPHY HAS BEEN OUTLAWED IN IRELAND AND THE GARDA' 
HAVE GREATER POWERS TO DEAL WITH THIS MATTER.
  
3. CARING FOR OUR ELDERLY CITIZENS (BACK TO TOP)

FINE GAEL, IN GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED PRO-RATA PENSIONS FOR 
PEOPLE WITH YEARLY AVERAGE OF BETWEEN 10 AND 20 PRSI 
CONTRIBUTIONS. 

  EXTENDED THE PERIOD FOR WHICH ARREARS ARE PAID IN LATE CLAIMS 
FROM 6 TO 12 MONTHS. 
 
IMPROVED THE METHOD OF ASSESSING CAPITAL/SAVINGS FOR RECIPIENTS 
OF THE OLD AGE NON-CONTRIBUTORY PENSION, WIDOW'S AND 
WIDOWER'S NON-CONTRIBUTORY PENSION AND PRE-RETIREMENT 
ALLOWANCE. 

 EXEMPTED FROM AN OLD AGE PENSIONER'S MEANS
TEST THE RENTAL INCOME FROM A PERSON LIVING WITH THAT PENSIONER . 

 ALLOWED DEPENDENT SPOUSES TO RETAIN ENTITLEMENT TO DENTAL AND 
OPTICAL TREATMENT BENEFITS WHEN THEY QUALIFY FOR OLD AGE 
PENSION IN THEIR OWN RIGHT. 
 
REFUNDED THE PENSION ELEMENT OF SELF-EMPLOYED PRSI 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO PEOPLE WHO ENTERED INSURANCE AFTER AGE 56 AND 
HAD EARLIER PRSI CONTRIBUTIONS. 

 ALLOWED ALL PENSIONERS OVER AGE 75 A FREE ELECTRICITY 
ALLOWANCE AND FREE TELEPHONE RENTAL ALLOWANCE REGARDLESS OF 
THEIR HOUSEHOLD CIRCUMSTANCES. 

 EXTENDED THE AGE LIMIT FOR FREE TELEPHONE RENTAL ALLOWANCE 
FROM 18 TO 22 FOR CHILDREN IN FULL-TIME EDUCATION AND RESIDENT 
WITH THE OLD AGE PENSIONER. 

  
EXTENDED THE DEFINITION OF WHO MAY RESIDE WITH A RECIPIENT OF 
FREE TELEPHONE RENTAL ALLOWANCE TO INCLUDE PERSONS WITH A 
HANDICAP 

 EXTENDED FREE TELEPHONE RENTAL ALLOWANCE TO A PENSIONER 
WHERE CONSTANT CARE AND ATTENTION IS BEING PROVIDED TO THAT 
PENSIONER (OR TO ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD) BY ANOTHER 
PERSON RESIDENT WITH THE PENSIONER (INCLUDING RECIPIENTS OF 
CARER'S ALLOWANCE). 

 PROVIDED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO GRANT AID SECURITY OF THE 
ELDERLY. 

  4. IMPROVING OUR HEALTH SERVICE (BACK TO TOP)

  FINE GAEL IN GOVERNMENT, HAS: 
REDUCED HOSPITAL WAITING LISTS 

HOSPITAL WAITING LISTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED WITH FINE GAEL 
IN GOVERNMENT. WE SPENT £8 MILLION IN 1995, £12M IN 1996 AND 
ANOTHER £8M IN THE FIRST HALF OF 1997, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION OF 
OVER 10,000 PEOPLE ON WAITING LISTS. BY EARLY 1997 WE HAD CUT 
THAT NUMBER TO UNDER 26,000.

 OPENED UP THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET. 

CHOICE AND COMPETITION ARE NOW A REALITY IN THE PRIVATE HEALTH 
INSURANCE MARKET FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH THE EMERGENCE OF BUPA 
ONTO THE MARKET. WHILE ENABLING THIS TO COME ABOUT, WE ALSO 
ENSURED THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF COMMUNITY RATING IS 
GUARANTEED.

 LAUNCHED A PLAN FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR HEALTH SERVICES FOR 
WOMEN.

 THE WOMEN'S HEALTH PLAN, PUT TOGETHER AFTER AN EXTENSIVE 
CONSULTATION PROCESS, ADDRESSSE THE PARTICULAR HEALTH ISSUES OF 
CONCERN TO WOMEN AND AIMS TO ENSURE THAT THESE ARE DEALT WITH 
THROUGHOUT THE IRISH HEALTH SERVICE. KEY COMPONENTS IN CREATING 
A QUALITY, WOMEN-FRIENDLY HEALTH SERVICE INCLUDED THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF A WOMEN'S HEALTH COUNCIL WITH SIMILARLY 
STRUCTURED BODIES IN EACH HEALTH BOARD, THE DEVELOPMENT OF A 
NATIONAL SCREENING PROGRAMME FOR BREAST CANCER AND A NATIONAL 
SCREENING PROGRAMME FOR CERVICAL CANCER.

 PUBLISHED A PLAN ON PHYSICAL AND SENSORY DISABILITY. 

PEOPLE WHO ARE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS PHYSICAL AND SENSORY 
DISABILITIES SUCH AS THOSE WHO ARE WHEELCHAIR BOUND, OR THOSE 
WHO SUFFER FROM BLINDNESS OR DEAFNESS, HAVE LONG AWAITED THE 
PUBLICATION OF A PLAN FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE SERVICES. THE 
REPORT OF THE REVIEW GROUP ON PERSONS WITH PHYSICAL AND 
SENSORY DISABILITY,PUBLISHED BY THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT IN 
DECEMBER 1996, PROVIDED SUCH A PLAN. THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
THESE SERVICES HAS BEEN ENHANCED BY AN EXTRA £3.6M IN 1997. 
REGIONAL CO-ORDINATING COMMITTEES WERE BEING PUT IN PLACE WHILE 
THE PROCESS OF COMPILING A DEFINITIVE DATABASE OF PEOPLE IN NEED 
OF THESE SERVICES WAS BEGUN.

 ESTABLISHED A NATIONAL INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY DATABASE. 

IN EACH OF ITS 3 BUDGETS, THE RAINBOW COALITION PROVIDED 
SIGNIFICANT EXTRA MONIES TO FUND IMPROVED SERVICES FOR THOSE 
WHO ARE MENTALLY HANDICAPPED. FOR THE FIRST TIME WE NOW HAVE A 
NATIONAL INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY DATABASE WHICH PROVIDES A LIST OF 
NAMED PERSONS WHO REQUIRE EITHER NEW OR IMPROVED SERVICES.
 
THE DATABASE HIGHLIGHTED, IN PARTICULAR, THE URGENT ADDITIONAL 
REQUIREMENTS FOR RESIDENTIAL CARE AS MENTALLY DISABLED PEOPLE ARE 
SURVIVING LONGER AND THEIR PARENTS, AS THEY GROW OLDER, REQUIRE 
EXTRA SUPPORT. RESPITE CARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CARERS AND ADEQUATE 
EDUCATIONAL AND TRANSPORT RESOURCES NEED TO BE ENHANCED AS A 
MATTER OF URGENCY. 

EACH YEAR SINCE COMING TO OFFICE THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT 
DEVOTED SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO DEVELOP SERVICES FOR 
MENTALLY HANDICAPPED PERSONS AND THEIR FAMILIES. IN 1997 AN 
EXTRA £12 MILLION WAS ALLOCATED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESIDENTIAL, 
DAYCARE AND RESPITE PLACES. 

THE DRUGS PROBLEM 

HEROIN ADDICTION, PARTICULARLY IN THE GREATER DUBLIN AREA, AND THE 
RAPIDLY INCREASING PREVALENCE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY OF SO-CALLED 
SOFT DRUGS SUCH AS ECSTASY ARE PROBLEMS WHICH REQUIRED AND GOT 
AN IMMEDIATE AND CO-ORDINATED RESPONSE FROM FINE GAEL IN 
GOVERNMENT. 

THE NEED TO REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR THESE DRUGS IS BEING TARGETED 
IN MANY WAYS: WAITING LISTS FOR METHADONE MAINTENANCE WERE 
DRAMATICALLY REDUCED; EXTRA DETOXIFICATION AND REHABILITATION 
FACILITIES WERE PROVIDED; ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT WAS PUT INTO DRUG 
AWARENESS PROGRAMMES AIMED AT YOUNG PEOPLE; A SPECIAL 
COMMITTEE OF MINISTERS OF STATE WAS SET UP TO CONCENTRATE ON 
DEMAND REDUCTION MEASURES. £14M HAS BEEN ALLOCATED IN 1997 
FOR A SERIES OF MEASURES RECOMMENDED BY THEIR FIRST REPORT. 
THESE MEASURES RECOGNISED THAT REDUCING DEMAND FOR DRUGS 
REQUIRES A COMPLEX, INTEGRATED APPROACH AT COMMUNITY LEVEL 
COMBINED WITH A NEED TO TACKLE THE SOCIAL FACTORS WHICH GIVE RISE 
TO DRUG ADDICTION.

 LAUNCHED THE FIRST NATIONAL PLAN FOR CANCER SERVICES.

 IN THE PAST, IRISH CANCER SERVICES HAVE DEVELOPED IN A LARGELY 
AD-HOC FASHION WITH MANY AREAS OF THE COUNTRY HAVING LITTLE OR NO 
SERVICE. THIS WILL CHANGE FOLLOWING THE ADOPTION AND LAUNCH, IN 
NOVEMBER 1996, OF THE FIRST NATIONWIDE ACTION PLAN FOR CANCER. 
A BUDGET ALLOCATION OF £6M ENABLED THE FIRST PHASE TO BE 
IMPLEMENTED. A KEY FEATURE IN ENSURING THAT ALL REGIONS HAVE AN 
APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF SERVICE WAS THE APPOINTMENT, AT CONSULTANT 
LEVEL, OF A DIRECTOR OF CANCER SERVICES IN EACH HEALTH BOARD 
AREA. IN ADDITION, SIGNIFICANT EXTRA RESOURCES WERE PROVIDED FOR 
HOSPICE CARE.

 "SO WHAT WOULD WE DO IN GOVERMENT?"  (BACK TO TOP)

  THE FINE GAEL MILLENNIUM PLEDGE - SUPPORTING FAMILIES AND 
IMPROVING HEALTHCARE

THE GOVERNMENT MUST SUPPORT THE FAMILY. THE FAMILY IS THE 
INSTITUTION WHICH BEST PROVIDES CARE, NURTURE AND LOVE FOR 
CHILDREN, FOR THE ELDERLY AND FOR THE INCAPACITATED. CHANGES IN 
SOCIETY SUCH AS THE GROWTH OF INDIVIDUALISM AND SECULARISATON, 
URBANISATION, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, CHANGING WORK PRACTICES AND 
CHANGED GENDER ROLES ARE PLACING SOME FAMILIES UNDER PRESSURE. 
IN SOME INSTANCES IMPAIRING THEIR CAPACITY TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE 
CARE FOR FAMILY MEMBERS IN NEED.

  THE GOVERNMENT MUST START BY ENSURING THAT NONE OF THE STATE'S 
POLICIES MAKE IT FINANCIALLY ATTRACTIVE FOR FAMILY UNITS TO BREAK UP. 
THE STATE SHOULD ENDEAVOUR TO SUPPORT FAMILIES BY TARGETED 
INTERVENTIONS WHICH ADDRESS STRESS POINTS IN THE FAMILY LIFECYCLE. 
IT SHOULD SUPPORT INITIATIVES FOR PRE-SCHOOL CHILD CARE; FOR CARE OF 
MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY INCAPACITATED FAMILY MEMBERS; AND FOR 
ASSISTING THE ELDERLY AND THEIR FAMILIES TO PROVIDE FOR LONG-TERM 
CARE NEEDS.

HELPING FAMILIES  (BACK TO TOP)

 APPOINT A MINISTER OF STATE FOR FAMILY AFFAIRS 

  IN THE MODERN WORLD, FAMILIES ARE PLACED UNDER INCREASING 
STRESS. THE ISSUES WHICH GIVE RISE TO THESE STRESSES, CROSS OVER 
SEVERAL ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT INCLUDING TAXATION, SOCIAL 
WELFARE, HEALTH, EDUCATION, JUSTICE AND LAW REFORM. BECAUSE OF 
THE BREADTH OF ISSUES WHICH ARISE AND BECAUSE OF OUR 
COMMITMENT TO THE FAMILY, FINE GAEL WILL APPOINT A MINISTER OF 
STATE FOR FAMILY AFFAIRS. 
  
  RE-EXAMINETHE UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PARENTAL MEANS 
TEST 


 FINE GAEL IS CONCERNED THAT THE OPERATION OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT 
ASSISTANCE PARENTAL MEANS TEST AND THE AVAILABILITY OF RENT 
ALLOWANCES CAN SOMETIMES ACT TO ENCOURAGE YOUNG PEOPLE TO 
LEAVE THE FAMILY HOME PREMATURELY, THEREBY FRACTURING THE FAMILY 
UNIT. THE TREATMENT OF THE YOUNG PERSON AS AN INDIVIDUAL IN HIS OR 
HER OWN RIGHT IS AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE, BUT OUR AIM WILL BE TO 
ENSURE THAT THERE IS NO ARTIFICIAL INCENTIVE ENCOURAGING YOUNG 
PEOPLE TO LEAVE HOME. 
  
SUPPORTING THE CARE OF OUR CHILDREN (BACK TO 
TOP)

INCREASINGLY BOTH PARENTS ARE WORKING FULL-TIME. THIS TREND IS SET 
TO CONTINUE AND WILL HAVE PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES FOR THE WAY 
SOCIETY ORGANISES ITSELF, PARTICULARLY IN CARING FOR CHILDREN. MEN 
AND WOMEN ARE RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY 
COMBINING PAID WORK AND FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES, AND THE STATE 
SHOULD HELP THEM. THAT MEANS GIVING PRACTICAL SUPPORT TO JOB 
SHARING AND ENCOURAGING PARENTAL LEAVE. 

A NEW PARENTS' CHILDCARE SUPPLEMENT 
  
FINE GAEL IS FULLY COMMITTED TO STATE FINANCIAL SUPPORTS FOR CHILD-
CARE. THIS IS DONE PRIMARILY THROUGH UNIVERSAL CHILD BENEFIT 
PAYMENTS, WHICH THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT INCREASED BY UP TO 
60%. THE COSTS OF CHILD-REARING ARE ALSO EXPLICITLY RECOGNISED IN 
OUR SOCIAL WELFARE CODE, THROUGH ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS FOR 
CHILDREN IN THE RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS/ASSISTANCE AND 
FAMILY INCOME SUPPLEMENT. WHAT CHARACTERISES THESE PAYMENTS 
IS THAT THEY ARE PAID TO FAMILIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CHILD-CARE 
IS PAID FOR OR IS FREELY PROVIDED FROM WITHIN THE FAMILY'S OWN 
TIME AND RESOURCES. STATE SUPPORT IS CHILD CENTRED AND THUS 
NEUTRALITY EXISTS BETWEEN FAMILIES WHICH BUY IN CHILDCARE, AND 
THOSE WHO PROVIDE IT FROM THEIR OWN RESOURCES. THE PRINCIPLE OF 
NEUTRALITY AND FAIRNESS IS ONE WHICH FINE GAEL FULLY SUPPORTS.

  WE BELIEVE A FURTHER INITIATIVE IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE REAL 
ADDITIONAL CHILD-CARE SUPPORT TO FAMILIES. FINE GAEL PROPOSES THAT 
A PARENTS' CHILDCARE SUPPLEMENT OF £300 PER CHILD PER ANNUM, 
FOR CHILDREN UP TO THE AGE OF FIVE INCLUSIVE, BE INTRODUCED ON A 
PHASED BASIS AND PAID THROUGH THE EXISTING CHILD BENEFIT 
SCHEME. IN 1998, THE SUPPLEMENT SHOULD BE PAID IN RESPECT OF 1 
AND 2 YEAR OLDS AND IN 1999 IT SHOULD BE PAID FOR ALL CHILDREN UP 
TO 5 YEARS OF AGE, INCLUSIVE.
 
 ESTABLISH AN OMBUDSMAN FOR CHILDREN 

WE CALL FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT OFFICE OF 
OMBUDSMAN FOR CHILDREN WITH STATUTORY POWERS TO PROMOTE AAND 
PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF CHILDREN. 

 IMPLEMENT CHILDCARE SECTIONS OF PARTNERSHIP 2000 
  
FINE GAEL IS DETERMINED TO SEE A SPEEDY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 
COMMITMENTS GIVEN IN PARTNERSHIP 2000 IN RELATION TO CHILDCARE. 
SPECIFICALLY WE WANT: THE RELEVANT SECTION OF THE 1991 CHILD CARE 
ACT WHICH COVERS THE REGULATION OF SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS IN 
PRE-SCHOOL SERVICES IMPLEMENTED ; A NATIONAL REGISTRATION SYSTEM 
FOR CHILDCARERS ESTABLISHED; A NATIONALLY RECOGNISED SYSTEM OF 
CERTIFICATION AND ACCREDITATION FOR CHILDCARE WORKERS PROVIDING 
FOR AN APPROPRIATE MINIMUM QUALIFICATION. 

  WHILE WE SUPPORT THE VIGOROUS PURSUIT OF HIGH STANDARDS, AT THE 
SAME TIME WE DON'T WANT TO SEE WELL-RUN CRECHES HAVING TO CLOSE 
OR RATES TO BE RAISED SUBSTANTIALLY BECAUSE OF OVERLY BUREAUCRATIC 
STANDARDS.

  EXEMPT CHILDCARE FROM VAT 

  FINE GAEL BELIEVES THAT ALL CHILDCARE SERVICES ARE INHERENTLY 
EDUCATIONAL IN CHARACTER AND THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO CONSTRUCT A 
MEANINGFUL DISTINCTION BETWEEN CARING AND EDUCATIONAL SERVICES. 
THUS WE BELIEVE THAT CHILDCARE SERVICES SHOULD BE COMPLETELY 
EXEMPT FROM VALUE ADDED TAX. 

 INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF QUALITY CHILDCARE SERVICES 

  A REAL PROBLEM WHICH MANY FAMILIES, BUT ESPECIALLY THOSE IN 
RURAL AREAS, FACE IS AN INSUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF QUALITY CHILDCARE 
SERVICES. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM WE WANT TO SEE THE VARIOUS 
LOCAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES BEING ACTIVELY ENCOURAGED TO SUPPORT 
COMMUNITY AND PRIVATE PROVISION OF CHILDCARE SERVICES IN CO-
OPERATION WITH FÁS AND THE HEALTH BOARDS. AN EU FUNDED PILOT 
PROJECT UNDERTAKEN BY LIMERICK COUNTY ENTERPRISE BOARD AND 
WHICH INVOLVES A JOINT COMMUNITY-BASED FACILITY FOR CHILDREN AND 
THE ELDERLY, COULD SERVE AS A MODEL.

 
A BETTER DEAL FOR OUR ELDERLY CITIZENS (BACK TO 
TOP)

 INCREASE INCOME TAX EXEMPTION LIMITS FOR THE ELDERLY

OVER THE TERM OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT THE INCOM-TAX EXEMPTION 
LIMITS AND ALLOWANCES FOR PENSIONERS WILL BE INCREASED IN LINE 
WITH OUR COMMITMENTS TO IMPROVE THE GENERALEXEMPTION AND 
ALLOWANCES LEVELS. FOR PERSONS AGED BETWEEN 65 AND 75 WE WILL 
SEEK TO INCREASE THE EXEMPTION LIMITS FROM £4,600 
(SINGLE)/£9,200 (MARRIED TO £5,200 (SINGLE)/£10,400 (MARRIED). 
FOR PERSONS OVER 75, THE LIMITS WILL BE RAISED FROM £5,200 
(SINGLE)/£10,400 (MARRIED TO £5,200 (SINGLE)/£11,800 (MARRIED) 

INCREASE TAX FREE-ALLOWANCES FOR THE ELDERLY

THE AGE TAX FREE ALLOWANCE FOR PERSONS OVER WILL BE INCREASED 
FROM£400 (SINGLE)/£800 (MARRIED) TO £1000 (SINGLE)/ £2000 
(MARRIED. WE L ALSO CALL FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW HIGHER AGE 
ALLOWANCE FOR THE OVER 75S. THUS IN THE NEXT BUDGET, WE WILL 
BRING FORWARD A PROPOSAL FOR AN ENHANCED AGE ALLOWANCE OF £500 
(SINGLE)/£1000 (MARRIED) FOR PERSONS AGED OVER 75. THIS 
ALLOWANCE WILL BE PROGRESSIVELY RAISED TO £1,100 (SINGLE)/ 
£2,200 (MARRIED) OVER THE NEW TERM OF GOVERNMENT.

THESE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE AGE ALLOWANCES WHEN COMBINED WITH 
OUR COMMITMENTS IN RELATION TO GENERAL ALLOWANCES WILL MEAN THAT 
THE TAX-FREE ALLOWANCE FOR PERSONS AGED BETWEEN 65 AND 75 WILL 
RISE FROM £3,300 (SINGLE)/£6,600 (MARRIED) BY 2002. FOR 
PERSONS OVER 75 YEARS OF AGE, THEIR TAX FREE ALLOWANCE WILL BE 
INCREASED FROM £3,300 (SINGLE)/£6,600 (MARRIED) TO £5,500 
(SINGLE)/£11,000 (MARRIED) BY 2002

ENHANCE TAX TREATMENT OF SURVIVING SPOUSES

FINE GAEL BELIEVES THAT ALL PERSONS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN WHO 
BECOME WIDOWED SHOULD RETAIN THE FULL MARRIED PERSON'S TAX-FREE 
ALLOWANCE AND BANDS. FOR A PERSON WITHOUT DEPENDANTS THEY 
SHOULD RETAIN ENTITLEMENT TO THESE DEDUCTIONS FOR A TWO-YEAR 
PERIOD FOLLOWING THE YEAR OF BEREAVEMENT.
 
HEALTH CARE PROVISION FOR ELDERY PEOPLE 
  
ALL ELDERLY PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF 65 SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO A FREE 
MEDICAL CHECKUP BY THEIR GP EVERY YEAR. WE WOULD ALSO EXTEND 
ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAL CARDS TO ALL PERSONS OVER 75. WE WOULD 
EXAMINE WAYS OF ENSURING THAT SPECTACLES AND DENTURES ARE MORE 
READILY AVAILABLE TO THE OVER 65S. 

DAY-CARE AND RESIDENTIAL CENTRES FOR THE ELDERLY 

WE WOULD PUT IN PLACE AN ENHANCED CAPITAL PROGRAMME TO 
DEVELOP DAY CARE AND RESIDENTIAL CENTRES FOR OLDER PEOPLE. 

SPECIAL HOUSE REPAIR GRANTS FOR THE ELDERLY 

WE WOULD REVIEW THE PRESENT SCHEME OF SPECIAL HOUSING REPAIR 
GRANTS FOR THE ELDERLY WHICH IS FUNDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE 
ENVIRONMENT WITH A VIEW TO MAKE THE SCHEME MORE RESPONSIVE 
TO THE NEEDS OF THE ELDERLY.
  
FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR HEALTH SERVICE 
(BACK TO TOP)

HEALTH CARE IS A MAJOR PREOCCUPATION FOR ALL FAMILIES. WE ARE 
FORTUNATE THAT, IN IRELAND, WE HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH-CARE SERVICE 
WHICH PROVIDES NOT ONLY TOP-QUALITY CARE BUT ALSO COMPARES 
FAVOURABLY WITH ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. THERE IS OF COURSE 
ALWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT.

 WAITING LISTS 

  WE BELIEVE THAT THE REDUCTION OF WAITING LISTS SHOULD CONTINUE TO 
BE PRIORITISED. ON A PHASED BASIS WE FAVOUR THE INTRODUCTION OF A 
PROGRAMME TO ENSURE THAT THE WAITING PERIOD FOR OPERATIONS FOR 
HIP REPLACEMENTS, CATARACTS, CARDIAC, AND GYNAECOLOGICAL 
PROCEDURES VARICOSE VEINS AND EAR, NOSE AND THROAT (ENT) 
PROCEDURES FOR CHILDREN WOULD BE DRAMATICALLY CUT. FINE GAEL 
FEELS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A MAXIMUM WAITING PERIOD OF NO MORE 
THAN SIX MONTHS, FROM THE TIME OF GP REFERRAL TO THE TIME WHEN 
THE PATIENT IS OPERATED ON.  

WE WANT TO SEE THE MAXIMUM WAITING PERIOD FOR CARDIAC AND 
VARICOSE VEIN TREATMENT BE NO MORE THAN 12 MONTHS. 

SERVICES FOR THE PHYSICALLY DISABLED 

THE "REPORT OF THE REVIEW GROUP ON SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH 
PHYSICAL AND SENSORY DISABILITIES" HAS BEEN CONSIDERED BY AN 
INTER-DEPARTMENTAL TASKFORCE SET UP TO LOOK AT IMPLEMENTATION OF 
THE WIDER REPORT PUBLISHED BY THE COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF 
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WE SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS 
BLUEPRINT AS THE BASIS FOR A RADICAL IMPROVEMENT IN SERVICES SUCH 
AS DAY CARE, RESPITE, SHELTERED WORKSHOP, RESIDENTIAL, PERSONAL 
ASSISTANCE AND OTHER SERVICES.
 
NURSING COMMISSION 

A COMMISSION, CHAIRED BY JUDGE MELLA CARROLL HAS UNDERTAKEN A 
ROOT AND BRANCH REVIEW OF NURSING IN IRELAND. WE BELIEVE THAT ITS 
RECOMMENDATIONS SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED WHILE A SIMILAR REVIEW 
OF THE PARAMEDICAL PROFESSIONS SHOULD ALSO BE UNDERTAKEN. 

HEPATITIS C 

THE INFECTION FROM THE BLOOD SUPPLY OF MANY IRISH WOMEN AND 
MEN WITH HEPATITIS C IS ONE OF THE GREATEST DISASTERS IN THE 
HISTORY OF THE IRISH HEALTH SYSTEM.

MONITORING AND RE-ASSESSMENT,ON AN ONGOING BASIS, OF THE HEALTH 
CARE REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER NEEDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN 
DIAGNOSED AS POSITIVE FOR HEPATITIS C VIRUS/ANTIBODIES SHOULD BE 
CONTINUED. THIS SHOULD BE WITH A VIEW TO ENSURING THAT THE 
NECESSARY SUPPORT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. 
INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH SHOULD ALSO BE CONTINUED . 

STRATEGIC PARTNER FOR THE VHI 

  OVER 1.4 MILLION PEOPLE ARE MEMBERS OF THE VHI. THE 
CONTINUED STRENGTH OF THIS ORGANISATION, IN THE FACE OF COMPETITIVE 
PRESSURES, MUST BE ENSURED. ACCORDINGLY FINE GAEL URGES THAT 
THE COMPANY FORGE A STRATEGIC ALLIANCE WITH AN APPROPRIATE 
PARTNER. COMMUNITY RATING SHOULD ALSO REMAIN AS A CORE 
PRINCIPLE IN THE HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET.

MINISTER OF STATE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH

WE BELIEVE THAT A MINISTER OF STATE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH 
WHO WILL HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES INCLUDING 
DRUG AND ALCOHOL ADDICTION, HEALTH PROMOTION, AND THE IRISH 
MEDICINE BOARDS, SHOULD BE APPOINTED. THE MINISTER SHOULD ALSO 
HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPLEMENTING THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 
TASKFORCE ON SUICIDE. 

MENTAL HEALTH BILL 

LEGISLATION GOVERNING MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH 
INSTITUTIONS IS SIGNIFICANTLY OUT OF DATE. THIS LEGISLATION SHOULD BE 
UPDATED THROUGH THE PUBLICATION OF A MENTAL HEALTH BILL. 

STRUCTURAL REFORM 

THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND CHILDREN SHOULD BE RENAMED AS 
THE "DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND PERSONAL SOCIAL SERVICES" TO 
REFLECT THE GROWING SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE SERVICES. AN EASTERN 
HEALTH AUTHORITY WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL SERVICES IN THE 
DUBLIN, WICKLOW AND KILDARE SHOULD REPLACE THE PRESENT EASTERN 
HEALTH BOARD. THE QUESTION OF REPRESENTATION OF VOLUNTARY 
BODIES ON THE HEALTH BOARDS MUST BE DEALT WITH WHILE A PILOT 
SCHEME TO INTRODUCE BOARDS OF MANAGEMENT IN A NUMBER OF 
HEALTH BOARD HOSPITALS SHOULD BE SET UP.

 HIGH QUALITY BLOOD SUPPLY 
  
A SECURE, HIGH QUALITY BLOOD SUPPLY IS VITAL FOR THE IRISH HOSPITAL 
SERVICE. A RADICAL REFORM OF THE IRISH BLOOD TRANSFUSION SERVICE 
SHOULD BE INITIATED BY, AMONG OTHER MEASURES, IMPLEMENTING THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE FINLAY TRIBUNAL. RESOURCES SHOULD ALSO 
BE PROVIDED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW STATE OF THE ART 
HEADQUARTERS FOR THE BTSB. AS MANY IRISH PEOPLE TRAVEL TO 
EUROPE EITHER TO WORK, FOR BUSINESS OR ON HOLIDAYS, WORK AT 
EUROPEAN UNION LEVEL SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN TO ACHIEVE THIS 
OBJECTIVE.

 MENTAL HANDICAP PLAN 

  WE ARE COMMITTED TO A PLAN FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SERVICES OF 
THE MENTALLY HANDICAPPED BASED ON THE NATIONAL INTELLECTUAL 
DISABILITIES DATABASE. THIS WOULD COMPREHENSIVELY ADDRESS THE 
NEEDS OF CARERS AND HANDICAPPED PEOPLE OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD.

 ACTION PLAN FOR CANCER SERVICES 

CANCER IS AMONG THE THREE MAJOR CAUSES OF DEATH IN THE UNDER 65 
AGE GROUP IN IRELAND. WE ARE COMMITTED TO SEEING THE FULL 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REMAINING PHASES OF THE NATIONAL CANCER 
STRATEGY. THIS WOULD REORGANISE TREATMENT SERVICES ON A REGIONAL 
BASIS WITH THREE SUPRA-REGIONAL SERVICES IN DUBLIN, CORK AND 
GALWAY FOR THE MORE HIGHLY SPECIALISED TREATMENTS. THE SHORTAGE 
OF SPECIALIST ONCOLOGY SERVICES OUTSIDE THE DUBLIN AREA WOULD BE 
ELIMINATED, SPECIALIST PALLIATIVE CARE SERVICES WOULD BE DEVELOPED 
ON A PHASED BASIS AND A CANCER RESEARCH UNIT WOULD BE 
ESTABLISHED WITHIN THE HEALTH RESEARCH BOARD.
 
WOMEN'S HEALTH PLAN 
  
FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN TO DEVELOP OUR HEALTH SERVICES 
FOR WOMEN IS A CORE OBJECTIVE. THE CURRENT TARGETTED BREAST 
SCREENING PROGRAMME AND A CERVICAL SCREENING PROGRAMME 
MUST BE AVAILABLE ON A NATIONWIDE BASIS.

  A BETTER DEAL FOR CARERS  (BACK TO TOP)

  FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS WHO PROVIDE CARE FOR THEIR LOVED ONES 
ARE DESERVING OF STATE SUPPORT. THE STATE ALSO SAVES ON NOT 
HAVING TO PROVIDE RESIDENTIAL CARE IN MANY CASES. TO GIVE A 
PRACTICAL EDGE TO OUR SUPPORT FOR CARERS WE PROPOSE A NUMBER OF 
SPECIFIC INITIATIVES.

 CARER'S ALLOWANCE 
  
WE SUPPORT THE INTRODUCTION OF A SEVERE DEPENDENCY PREMIUM 
ON TOP OF EXISTING PAYMENTS FOR CARERS WHO ARE CARING FOR 
PERSONS ON THE VERGE OF NEEDING RESIDENTIAL CARE. WE ALSO FAVOUR 
AN EARNINGS DISREGARD FOR CARERS AND THE UNDULY RESTRICTIVE FULL-
TIME COMMITMENTS ON CARERS SHOULD BE RELAXED. 

MONITOR CARE FACILITIES 

THE PROPOSED SOCIAL SERVICES INSPECTORATE SHOULD HAVE A ROLE IN 
THE REGISTRATION AND INSPECTION OF LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES.
 
EXAMINE INTRODUCTION OF A PARTIAL EQUITY
RELEASE INSURANCE (PERI) SCHEME 

WE BELIEVE IT IS TIME TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT A PARTIAL EQUITY
 RELEASE INSURANCE (PERI) SCHEME TO BE RUN EITHER BY THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR OR IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE AS A MEANS OF FUNDING 
LONG-TERM CARE FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE. 

SUCH A SCHEME WOULD BE BASED ON THE FACT THAT MANY ELDERLY
PEOPLE ARE ASSET RICH BUT INCOME POOR WHEN IT COMES TO MEETING 
THE HIGH COST OF LONG-TERM CARE. A PERSON TAKING OUT PERI 
INSURANCE WOULD HAVE NO OUTLAY UPFRONT BUT WOULD AGREE WITH 
THE INSURER  THAT FOLLOWING THE INDIVIDUAL'S DEATH THE FIRST CLAIM 
ON THE DECEASED'S ESTATE WOULD BE HELD BY THE INSURANCE AGENCY. 
THIS CLAIM WOULD MORE THAN LIKELY BE IN TERMS OF A PERCENTAGE OF 
THE ASSET VALUE.

A DEGREE OF STATE SUPPORT MAY BE NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH PERIS 
BOTH TO REASSURE POTENTIAL INSUREES AND TO ATTRACT INVESTORS 
INTERESTED IN LONG-TERM RETURNS. IT MAY ALSO BE NECESSARY TO 
INTRODUCE APPROPRIATE CONSUMER LEGISLATION TO PROTECT THE INSUREE. 
INCENTIVES FOR THE ELDERLY TO PARTICIPATE IN PERIS MAY ALSO BE 
WARRANTED. THE OPTION OF RECOUPING ANY STAMP DUTY PAID ON THE  
SALE OF A DECEASED PERSONS PROPERTY TO THE ESTATE OF THAT DECEASED 
PERSON SHOULD ALSO BE EXAMINED.

 EXTENSIVE SYSTEM OF RESPITE CARE 

  A MORE EXTENSIVE SYSTEM OF RESPITE CARE AND "BREAKAWAY"  
SERVICES FOR CARERS AND THE CARING FAMILIES SHOULD BE PROMOTED 
THROUGH  THE HEALTH BOARDS.PERSONS WHO LOOK AFTER ELDERLY 
DEPENDANTS AT  HOME SHOULD BE ENABLED TO HAVE MID-WEEK 
BREAKS, WEEK-END BREAKS  AND HOLIDAYS. 

TAX ALLOWANCES FOR PAID IN-HOME NURSING CARE 

THE EXISTING PERSONAL TAX ALLOWANCE FOR PAID IN-HOME NURSING  
CARE SHOULD BE IMPROVED AND WE ALSO URGE A RELAXATION OF THE  
REGULATIONS, SUBJECT TO SATISFACTORY ANTI-AVOIDANCE MEASURES, 
GOVERNING THE COVERAGE OF THE PRESENT ALLOWANCE TO PERMIT 
SIBLINGS TO AVAIL OF  THE CONCESSION WHEN THE RECIPIENT OF THE CARE 
IS A PARENT OR ANOTHER SIBLING. 

SUMMARY
FINE GAEL HAS PRO-ACTIVELY PROMOTED A CARING APPROACH TO  
FAMILIES, CHILDREN, OUR ELDERLY AND THE HEALTH SERVICE. FINE  
GAEL HAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED HOSPITAL WAITING LISTS, GIVEN  
PEOPLE OPTION FOR PRIVATE HEALTH COVER, DEVELOPED STRONG HEALTH  
POLICIES FOR WOMEN AND ALSO FOR PERSONS WITH PHYSICAL AND  
INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES, TACKLED THE DRUGS PROBLEM AND LAUNCHED  
THE FIRST NATIONAL PLAN FOR CANCER SERVICES. FINE GAEL CARES FOR  
PEOPLE.


 EDUCATION

  POLICIES ON EDUCATION AND TRAINING

  POLICIES ON EDUCATION AND TRAINING

OUR PHILOSOPHY

FINE GAEL HAS LONG BELIEVED THAT EDUCATING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO  
COMPETE IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING WORLD HAS TO BE A PRIORITY. WE 
ALSO NEED TO PRIORITISE THE  IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUING EDUCATION. 
HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO DO BOTH OF THESE, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT OUR  
EDUCATION SYSTEM CONSTANTLY ADAPTS TO EXTERNAL CHANGES. THE 
EDUCATION SYSTEM AT ALL LEVELS  OFFERS THE SINGLE GREATEST 
OPPORTUNITY FOR IRELAND TO BUILD A TALENTED WORKFORCE WHICH IS  
ABLE TO COMPETE ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE. 

WE ARE NOW REAPING THE BENEFITS OF THE FAR-SEEING DECISION IN THE  
1960S TO ABOLISH FEES FOR SECOND-LEVEL EDUCATION. THIS HAS  
RESULTED IN A DIRECT CONTRIBUTION TO OUR GROWTH PERFORMANCE BY  
PRODUCING A SKILLED AND ADAPTABLE WORKFORCE. BUT THIS DECISION  
HAS ALSO INDIRECTLY ADVANCED OUR PROSPERITY BY BEING ONE OF THE  
PIVOTAL FACTORS ATTRACTING FOREIGN INVESTMENT TO THIS COUNTRY.

IT IS PERHAPS FITTING THAT 30 YEARS AGYTER FREE SECOND LEVEL  
EDUCATION WAS INTRODUCED THIS GOVERNMETN ABOLISHED FEES FOR  
THIRD LEVEL UNDERGRADUATE COURSES.

FINE GAEL BELIEVES THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL TO VIEW EDUCATION AND  
TRAINING AS COMPLEMENTARY. A SOUND EDUCATION AT PRIMARY, 
SECOND AND THIRD LEVEL SHOULD  PROVIDE ALL STUDENTS WITH A 
GROUNDING IN THE FUNDAMENTAL AND ENDURING ELEMENTS OF ALL  
KNOWLEDGE. TRAINING, WHICH INVOLVES EITHER LEARNING BY 
INSTRUCTION OR "LEARNING BY DOING" PROVIDES FOR  THE NEEDS OF THE 
PRESENT, WHILE EDUCATION PROVIDES FOR THE NEEDS WHICH MAY ARISE 
IN THE FUTURE.  A SOUND BASIC EDUCATION EARLY IN LIFE, 
SUPPLEMENTED BY CONSTANT RE-TRAINING, PROVIDES A  PLATFORM FOR 
LIFELONG LEARNING. A JUDICIOUS BALANCE BETWEEN EDUCATION AND 
TRAINING IS THUS REQUIRED  TO ADVANCE PROSPERITY BOTH FOR 
INDIVIDUALS AND FOR THE NATION.

  SO WHAT DID WE DO? (BACK TO TOP)

1. CUT THE PRIMARY SCHOOL PUPIL - TEACHER RATIO

A KEY FACTOR AFFECTING THE QUALITY OF THE EDUCATION OUR CHILDREN  
RECEIVE IS THE NUMBER OF PUPILS EACH TEACHER HAS IN HIS OR HER 
CLASSROOM. THE RAINBOW  GOVERNMENT CUT THAT AVERAGE NUMBER 
FROM 25 TO 22. THAT MEANS BETTER EDUCATION FOR ALL OUR CHILDREN,  
AND MORE TIME FOR TEACHERS TO CONCENTRATE ON CHILDREN WHO NEED 
SPECIAL HELP.

  2. LAUNCHED A NEW PROGRAMME CALLED BREAKING THE CYCLE

  BREAKING THE CYCLE, AN INNOVATIVE PROGRAMME WHICH INVOLVES  
HIGHLY TARGETED INTERVENTIONS IN 50 PRIMARY SCHOOLS LOCATED IN 
DISADVANTAGED AREAS WITH THE  OBJECTIVE OF COMBATING 
DISADVANTAGE, WAS ESTABLISHED. CLASS SIZES WERE REDUCED IN THESE  
SCHOOLS TO 15 PUPILS FOR EVERY TEACHER. THE RESULTS FROM THIS 
INITIATIVE SHOULD HAVE  IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR HOW THE 
PROBLEM OF EDUCATIONAL DISADVANTAGE IS TACKLED OVER THE NEW  
GOVERNMENT'S TERM. 
  
3. ABOLISHED THIRD-LEVEL FEES
  
WE ABOLISHED THIRD-LEVEL FEES WHICH WERE CAUSING GREAT HARDSHIP  
TO MANY MIDDLE-INCOME FAMILIES AND DENYING ACCESS TO MANY 
CHILDREN TO THIS SECTOR. THIS  MEANS THAT ON AVERAGE FAMILIES WILL 
SAVE £1,500 FOR EVERY CHILD AT COLLEGE EACH YEAR.

 
4. NATIONAL SPORTS STRATEGY
  
WE LAUNCHED A NATIONAL SPORTS STRATEGY WHICH COMMITS THE  
GOVERNMENT TO AN ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURE OF £1.6 MILLION IN EACH 
YEAR UP TO THE MILLENNIUM TO  IMPROVE THE PLACE OF SPORT IN ALL 
OUR LIVES. 
  
5. EDUCATION BILL
  
THE EDUCATION BILL DEVOLVES THE PROVISION OF EDUCATIONAL 
SERVICES TO REGIONAL LEVEL. IT WOULD HAVE ESTABLISHED BOARDS OF  
MANAGEMENT IN ALL SCHOOLS IN RECEIPT OF PUBLIC FUNDING AND 
WOULD HAVE PLACED THE DEPARTMENT  OF EDUCATION'S INSPECTORATE 
ON A STATUTORY BASIS. THIS INSPECTORATE WOULD BE CHARGED WITH  
HELPING SCHOOLS TO PLAN CHANGE. IT WOULD HAVE IMPROVED THE 
QUALITY OF OUR EDUCATIONAL  SERVICES FOR OUR CHILDREN. THE BILL WILL 
GIVE A GREATER VOICE TO PARENTS.

  6. UNIVERSITIES ACT
  
WE ENACTED THE MOST RADICAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION IN THE  
UNIVERSITIES' SECTOR FOR NEARLY A CENTURY. THIS WILL MAKE 
UNIVERSITIES MORE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE  PUBLIC, TO PARENTS, TO 
STUDENTS AND TO THE WIDER COMMUNITY, AND THUS MAKE THEM MORE  
RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF SOCIETY.


THE FINE GAEL MILLENIUM PLEDGE FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING

EVERY 12 YEAR OLD SHOULD BE ABLE TO READ, WRITE, HAVE A BASIC  
COMMAND OF MATHS AND SCIENCE, LOG ON TO THE INTERNET, SPEAK A  
CONTINENTAL LANGUAGE; EVERY 17 YEAR OLD SHOULD HAVE A  
SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE IN AT LEAST THE JUNIOR CERTIFICATE; EVERY  
SCHOOL LEAVER, SHOULD, AT THE VERY MINIMUM, HAVE ACHIEVED A  
POST LEAVING CERTIFICATE QUALIFICATION; AND EVERY ADULT IRISH  
PERSON SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO KEEP ON LEARNING FOR THEIR ENTIRE  
LIFETIME 

FINE GAEL HAS SIX POLICY GOALS IT WILL STRIVE TO ACHIEVE DURING THE  
LIFETIME OF THE MILLENIUM GOVERNMENT. THEY ARE TO:

1. EMPHASISE THE EDUCATION OF THE WHOLE PERSON

2. CREATE A RESPONSIVE EDUCATION SYSTEM.

3. INCREASE PARTICIPATION AND IMPROVE PERFORMANCE LEVELS.

4. DEEPEN THE QUALITY OF OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM.

5. ENCOURAGE MORE CONTINUING EDUCATION AND TRAINING.

6. UPGRADE THE QUALITY AND RELEVANCE OF TRAINING COURSES. 

 
1. EDUCATION OF THE WHOLE PERSON (BACK TO TOP)

A SOUND WELL-ROUNDED EDUCATION CALLS FOR AN APPROACH WHICH  
EMPHASISES THE EDUCATION OF THE WHOLE PERSON. THE ROLE OF NON-
ACADEMIC ACTIVITIES SHOULD HAVE A  PROMINENT AND VALUED PLACE IN 
THE CURRICULUM OF SCHOOLS SO AS TO PROMOTE THE SOCIAL, CULTURAL,  
PERSONAL AND PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE.THE 
PROVISION OF THESE ACTIVITIES IN  OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM SHOULD BE 
EVALUATED WITH A VIEW TO SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCING THEIR DELIVERY.  
IN THIS REGARD THE ROLE OF GUIDANCE AND COUNSELLING SERVICES 
SHOULD ALSO BE DEVELOPED.

IN RESPECT OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WE BELIEVE THAT ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT  
IN SPORTS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE FORMATION OF THE YOUNG 
PERSON. FINE GAEL CALLS FOR THE  IMPLEMENTATION OF A KEY 
RECOMMENDATION OF THE SPORTS STRATEGY GROUP BY CREATING A  
CABINET PLACE FOR SPORT IN ORDER TO ELEVATE SPORTS TO A CENTRAL 
PLACE IN GOVERNMENT ACTIVITY.

 
2. CREATING A RESPONSIVE EDUCATION SYSTEM  
(BACK TO TOP)

SUPPORTING DIVERSE MANAGEMENT STRUCTURES 
  
WE BELIEVE DIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENT STRUCTURES IS A QUALITY WHICH  
IS INTRINSICALLY VALUABLE IN OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. FINE GAEL 
SEES THE PROMOTION OF A  STATUTORY BASIS FOR PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT 
IN THE EDUCATION BILL AS A MAJOR ADVANCE ON THE  EXISTING 
SITUATION. FINE GAEL BELIEVES THERE MUST BE EXTENSIVE 
CONSULTATION WITH THE EDUCATION  PARTNERS BEFORE ANY NEW 
MANAGEMENT STRUCTURES ARE PUT IN PLACE. 

 INVOLVE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN THIRD LEVEL INSTITUTIONS 
  
AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO UPGRADE RESPONSIVENESS IS TO INVOLVE THE  
WIDER COMMUNITY, AT BOTH LOCAL AND NATIONAL LEVEL, IN THIRD LEVEL 
COURSE PLANNING AND REVIEW.  THIRD-LEVEL INSTITUTIONS NEED TO BE 
CAPABLE OF FLEXIBLY RESPONDING TO THE NEEDS OF THE ECONOMY  
WITHOUT COMPROMISING ACADEMIC STANDARDS. THE MANAGEMENT OF 
COLLEGES MUST ANTICIPATE  DEVELOPMENTS IN THE JOB MARKET PLACE 
AND RESPOND SPEEDILY BY ADAPTING THEIR TEACHING  PROGRAMMES. 
OF COURSE, ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS MUST LOOK BEYOND THE 
IMMEDIATE REQUIREMENTS OF  BUSINESS FOR GRADUATES WITH SKILLS 
"OF THE MOMENT", AND PROVIDE FOR LONGER TERM NEEDS TOO.  THE 
PROCEDURES LAID DOWN FOR ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE IN THE 
UNIVERSITIES' LEGISALTION WILL  PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CHECKS AND 
IMPROVE THE LEVEL OF RESPONSIVENESS.

 USING EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES AS COMMUNITY RESOURCES 
  
FINE GAEL BELIEVES OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS NEED TO BE  
RESPONSIVE TO LOCAL NEED IN TERMS OF THE USE OF EDUCATIONAL 
RESOURCES. THE LOGISTICAL, INSURANCE AND  OTHER ISSUES INVOLVED IN 
MAKING SCHOOL AND COLLEGE FACILITIES SUCH AS SPORTS GROUNDS,  
CLASS ROOMS AND ASSEMBLY HALLS AVAILABLE TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES 
SHOULD BE EXAMINED.

.  
3. INCREASE PARTICIPATION AND IMPROVE 
PERFORMANCE LEVELS (BACK TO TOP)

ALL THE INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT INVESTMENT  
IN EDUCATION IS THE BEST INVESTMENT AN INDIVIDUAL CAN MAKE EITHER 
FOR THEMSELVES OR FOR  THEIR CHILDREN. IT IS A TRAGEDY, THEREFORE, 
THAT EACH YEAR ABOUT 13,000 STUDENTS EITHER DROP OUT  FROM 
SECOND-LEVEL WITHOUT QUALIFICATION, OR PERFORM POORLY IN STATE 
EXAMINATIONS. MANY OF  THESE CHILDREN FACE A FUTURE OF 
UNEMPLOYMENT AND ARE OFTEN PLACED AT SOCIAL RISK. 

  INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THERE ARE IMPORTANT INTER- 
GENERATIONAL AND "NEIGHBOURHOOD" EFFECTS WHICH INFLUENCE 
EDUCATIONAL CHOICES. EVEN SEEING ONE  MEMBER OF A PARTICULAR 
FAMILY SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE SECOND LEVEL SCHOOL, OR SEEING ONE 
18- YEAR OLD IN A DISADVANTAGED AREA ATTEND THIRD LEVEL LEADS TO 
IMITATION BY OTHERS FROM THE SAME  FAMILY OR NEIGHBOURHOOD. 
THE STATE HAS A ROLE IN "KICK-STARTING" THIS PROCESS IN 
DISADVANTAGED  COMMUNITIES. BY IGNITING THE SPARK IN EVEN A 
SMALL WAY, INVESTMENT COULD TAKE OFF THROUGH THE  COMPOUNDING 
EFFECTS OF THESE "NEIGHBOURHOOD" AND GENERATIONAL EFFECTS.

 DIVERT RESOURCES TOWARDS DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN 

  WE BELIEVE RESOURCES RELEASED BY THE SO-CALLED "DEMOGRAPHIC  
DIVIDEND" MUST BE DIVERTED, WHICH WILL ARISE BECAUSE OF THE 
ANTICIPATED DECLINE IN PRIMARY  STUDENT NUMBERS, TOWARDS 
DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN IN ALL SCHOOLS BY INVESTING IN ADDITIONAL  
REMEDIAL TEACHERS, HOME-SCHOOL LINKS, SOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL 
SUPPORT SERVICES  AND IMPROVED TEACHER TRAINING AND SCHOOL 
EQUIPMENT. THESE FREED-UP RESOURCES SHOULD BE USED  SELECTIVELY 
TO ACHIEVE CONSCIOUSLY PLANNED OUTCOMES, AND NOT JUST ABSORBED 
IN A  GENERALISED WAY.  

EDUCATION AND TRAINING TO AGE 18 

IN GOVERNMENT, WE WOULD ENSURE THAT EVERY CHILD UP TO AGE 18  
WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN SECOND-LEVEL 
EDUCATION, TRAINING PROGRAMMES,  YOUTH REACH, OR OTHER 
PATHWAYS TO WORK. 

ESTABLISH TWO KEY AIMS 

  WE FAVOUR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TWO KEY INDICATORS ON WHICH TO  
JUDGE PERFORMANCE. FIRST, BY THE AGE OF 12, WE WILL SEEK TO 
ENSURE THAT CHILDREN WILL HAVE  ATTAINED A MINIMUM SPECIFIED LEVEL 
IN LITERACY AND NUMERACY SKILLS. SECONDLY, EVERY 17 YEAR OLD  
SHOULD HAVE A SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE IN, AT LEAST, THE JUNIOR 
CERTIFICATE.

 EXPAND THE YOUTHREACH PROGRAMME 
  
FINE GAEL IS IMPRESSED WITH THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE YOUTHREACH  
PROGRAMME IN ADDRESSING THE PROBLEMS OF DISADVANTAGE. WE 
DEMAND GREATER COVERAGE OF  YOUNG PEOPLE IN NEED AND THAT 
PARTICIPANTS PROGRESS TO A TRADABLE QUALIFICATION.

 PROMOTE PARTICIPATION IN POST LEAVING CERTIFICATE COURSES 
  
STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN TO ENCOURAGE PROGRESSION IN EDUCATIONAL  
ATTAINMENT BEYOND LEAVING CERTIFICATE FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO DO 
NOT WISH TO ATTEND THIRD- LEVEL COLLEGES OR TAKE UP AN 
APPRENTICESHIP BY ACTIVELY PROMOTING PARTICIPATION IN  
APPROPRIATELY ACCREDITED POST LEAVING CERTIFICATE COURSES OR THE 
NEW NATIONAL TRAINEESHIPS'  PROGRAMMES.THE EXTENSION OF 
MAINTENANCE GRANTS TO STUDENTS ATTENDING SUCH COURSES AS SOON AS  
RESOURCES PERMIT,SHOULD BE PRIORITISED.

  4. DEEPEN THE QUALITY OF OUR EDUCATION 
SYSTEM 
(BACK TO TOP)

TO MAINTAIN OUR COMPETITIVE EDGE FINE GAEL BELIEVES WE NEED TO  
MOVE WITH SOME HASTE TOWARDS UPGRADING COMPUTER AND 
LANGUAGE SKILLS AT PRIMARY AND  SECOND LEVEL.

 ACHIEVE COMPUTER LITERACY AT ALL LEVELS 

  THE ATTAINMENT OF A STANDARD OF COMPUTER LITERACY AT ALL LEVELS  
AMONG TEACHERS AND STUDENTS IS AN OBJECTIVE OF FINE GAEL. 
SPECIFICALLY, WE WANT ALL SCHOOL- LEAVING STUDENTS TO OBTAIN A 
THOROUGH GROUNDING IN COMPUTER SKILLS. THE AIM WOULD BE TO  
INTEGRATE COMPUTERS INTO THE WHOLE TEACHING AND LEARNING 
EXPERIENCE. 

 SET A TARGET PUPIL / COMPUTER RATIO 

  WE BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE AT LEAST ONE PERSONAL COMPUTER FOR  
EVERY 20 STUDENTS AT PRIMARY AND SECOND LEVEL. THE PRIVATE SECTOR 
SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO  SUPPORT THIS INVESTMENT.
 
PROMOTE CYBER SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES 
  
THE CONCEPT OF "CYBER SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES" AND NETWORKING  
SHOULD BE PROMOTED THROUGH ENSURING THAT EVERY CLASSROOM IS 
LINKED TO THE INTERNET, AND  TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS FEASIBLE, 
HAS ISDN CAPABILITY.

 INTRODUCE A "VIRTUAL UNIVERSITY" PILOT PROJECT 
  
FINE GAEL BELIEVES THAT THERE IS TREMENDOUS SCOPE FOR USING  
MODERN TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES TO IMPROVE ACCESS, ENHANCE 
QUALITY AND REDUCE THE COSTS  OF DELIVERING THIRD-LEVEL COURSES 
FROM CENTRAL LOCATIONS TO OUTLYING COMMUNITY CENTRES.  THE 
CONCEPT OF A "VIRTUAL" INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEVEL LEARNING IS ON THE 
BRINK OF REALISATION IN  IRELAND. FINE GAEL SUPPORTS THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF A MAJOR PILOT PROJECT TO ADVANCE THIS CONCEPT. 



INNOVATIVE PLANS ARE WELL ADVANCED BY THE CORK INSTITUTE OF  
TECHNOLOGY AND THE THIRD LEVEL CAMPUS GROUP AT SKIBBERREEN, 
CO. CORK TO DEVELOP A PROTOTYPE  OF THIS CONCEPT. THE LOCAL 
GROUP HAVE ESTABLISHED LINKS WITH SIMILAR PROJECTS AT THE  
UNIVERSITY OF ULSTER AT ENNISKILLEN AND AT THE UNIVERSITY OF 
MISSOURI AT ST. LOUIS. WE BELIEVE THIS  PROJECT HAS THE POTENTIAL 
TO BE A MODEL NOT JUST FOR THE INNOVATIVE SUPPLY OF THIRD-LEVEL 
EDUCATION  IN THE 21ST CENTURY BUT IT ALSO CAN SERVE TO PROMOTE 
RURAL REGENERATION. BY RETAINING THOSE  STUDENTS WHO CHOOSE TO 
STAY CLOSE TO THEIR COMMUNITIES TO BE EDUCATED THROUGH PROVIDING 
A  TELEMATICS RESOURCE, WHICH CAN BE USED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE 
BUSINESS, CULTURAL, SOCIAL AND  SPORTING ACTIVITIES OF LOCAL RURAL 
COMMUNITIES. MODERN TECHNOLOGY CAN HELP PROMOTE RURAL  
REGENERATION OF RECENT YEARS. 

ACHIEVE A GREATER FLUENCY IN CONTINENTAL LANGUAGES 

  IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT WE IMPROVE OUR COMMAND OF  
CONTINENTAL LANGUAGES. WHILE ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE MAY BE THE 
GOAL FOR SOME, BASIC LITERACY AND  CONVERSATIONAL SKILLS IN THESE 
LANGUAGES IS THE GOAL WE SEEK TO ACHIEVE FOR ALL.

  WE BELIEVE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO BUILD LANGUAGE CAPABILITY 
IS  TO COMMENCE A CONTINENTAL LANGUAGE PROGRAMME AT PRIMARY 
LEVEL. FINE GAEL'S AIM WILL BE TO  ENSURE THAT BY THE YEAR 2010 
EVERY 12-YEAR OLD PRIMARY SCHOOL LEAVER SHOULD HAVE ATTAINED A  
BASIC FLUENCY IN ONE CONTINENTAL LANGUAGE. THIS WILL INVOLVE 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE  TIMETABLE IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS, A 
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN TEACHER TRAINING AND THE USE OF VISITING  
TEACHERS. SUCH A RADICAL DEVELOPMENT WILL REQUIRE FULL 
CONSULTATION WITH ALL INTERESTED  PARTIES.
  
AT THIRD LEVEL, WE BELIEVE THAT ALL GRADUATING STUDENTS SHOULD  
HAVE A PROFICIENCY IN APPLIED CONTINENTAL LANGUAGE SKILLS. TO 
ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, A  COMMISSION SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED,IN 
CONJUNCTION WITH THE HEA, TO RECOMMEND A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR THE  
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS OBJECTIVE.

5. ENCOURAGE CONTINUING EDUCATION AND 
TRAINING (BACK TO TOP)

EDUCATION AND TRAINING SHOULDN'T CEASE WHEN ONE JOINS THE  
WORKFORCE. FINE GAEL BELIEVES THAT EVERYONE SHOULD BE 
ENCOURAGED TO TAKE PART IN CONTINUING  EDUCATION AND TRAINING 
THROUGHOUT THEIR WORKING LIFE. 

WE PROPOSE, SUBJECT TO AVAILABLE RESOURCES, TO ALLOW ALL FEES  
INCURRED FOR APPROPRIATELY ACCREDITED COURSES TO BE TAX DEDUCTIBLE 
AT THE STANDARD RATE.  INITIALLY THIS SHOULD APPLY TO CERTAIN IT 
COURSES AND THE LEARNING OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES. FINE  GAEL ARE 
COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING, THROUGH SUITABLE INCENTIVES, LIFELONG 
LEARNING FOR ALL  OUR PEOPLE AND WE INTEND TO EXTEND THE RANGE OF 
COURSES ELIGIBLE OVER TIME. 

GREATER INVESTMENT IN TELEMATICS 

LACK OF ACCESS TO CENTRES OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING CONSTRAINS THE  
WIDESPREAD PARTICIPATION IN CONTINUING EDUCATION AND TRAINING FOR 
WORKING PERSONS OR  PERSONS WITH YOUNG FAMILIES TO REAR. WE 
BELIEVE THAT INVESTMENT IN TELEMATICS TECHNOLOGY HAS THE  POTENTIAL 
TO CONSIDERABLY IMPROVE ACCESS AND SPECIAL PRIORITY SHOULD BE 
GIVEN TO THIS TYPE OF  INVESTMENT IN FUTURE CAPITAL PROGRAMMES.
  
6. UPGRADE THE QUALITY AND RELEVANCE OF 
TRAINING COURSES (BACK TO TOP)

SUPPORTING NEW INITIATIVES FOR TRAINING 

FINE GAEL CALLS FOR THE RAPID IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RAINBOW  
GOVERNMENT'S WHITE PAPER ON HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT. 
IN PARTICULAR, FINE GAEL BELIEVES  TRAINING FOR UNEMPLOYED 
PERSONS SHOULD BE TAILORED TO ASSIST THEM PREPARE FOR THE  
WORKPLACE THROUGH THE LOCAL EMPLOYMENT SERVICE. THE 
EMPHASIS HAS TO BE PLACED ON THE  SUPPLY OF RELEVANT AND 
APPROPRIATE TRAINING PROGRAMMES LEADING TO ACCREDITED  
QUALIFICATIONS AND THE PATH TO FULL-TIME EMPLOYMENT. WE SUPPORT 
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF INTENSIVE SHORT  COURSES ON JOB SEARCH 
SKILLS TAILORED TO THE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED. 

LINK SECOND-LEVEL WITH TRAINEESHIPS 

  FINE GAEL SEE CONSIDERABLE MERIT IN LINKING THE PROVISION OF  
TRAINEESHIPS PROVIDED BY FAS WITH THE SECOND-LEVEL CURRICULUM. 
WE BELIEVE THERE IS MERIT IN  EXAMINING THE PROVISION FOR STUDENT 
ACCESS TO TRAINEE OPPORTUNITIES AFTER THEIR JUNIOR CERTIFICATE BUT AS  
PART OF THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM.

AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO COMPLETING THE SENIOR CYCLE, STUDENTS  
SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPT FOR AN ACCREDITED TRAINEESHIP, 
APPRENTICESHIP ETC. THIS OPTION PROVIDES  REAL ALTERNATIVES FOR 
MANY STUDENTS WHO MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO ADJUST TO THE ACADEMIC  
EMPHASIS AT SECOND LEVEL WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ALLOWING OUR 
ECONOMY TO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF A  WIDER RANGE OF SKILLED PERSONS. 
IN TIME, THE QUALIFICATIONS GAINED THROUGH THESE TRAINEESHIPS, AND  
OTHER MEASURES, COULD BE RECOGNISED AS APPROPRIATE FOR ENTRY 
REQUIREMENTS TO THIRD-LEVEL  INSTITUTES OF TECHNOLOGY.

  CRIME


POLICIES ON CRIME (BACK TO TOP)

FINE GAEL  IDENTIFIED CRIME AS ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT NEEDED TO TACKLE. WE PLEDGED THAT IN GOVERNMENT 
WE WOULD DEVISE AND IMPLEMENT A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO FIGHT 
CRIME. THIS PLAN  INVOLVED: 

 MAJOR CHANGES IN CRIMINAL LAW. 
 REFORM OF OUR PENAL SYSTEM. 
 IMPROVEMENTS IN RELATION TO THE GARDA
 SIOCHANA. 


IN DECEMBER 1994, FINE GAEL IMMEDIATELY SET ABOUT 
IMPLEMENTING A COMPREHENSIVE CRIME PLAN. IN JUST 29 MONTHS, 
FINE GAEL  ACHIEVED ALL THREE OF THESE PLEDGES AND MUCH MORE. 
ANY OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT MUST RECOGNISE THE SHEER BREADTH OF 
REFORM ACROSS ALMOST EVERY ELEMENT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE 
SYSTEM. FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1989, INDICTABLE CRIME  
DECREASED.

  SO WHAT DID WE DO IN GOVERNMENT?  (BACK TO
TOP)


1. MAJOR CHANGES IN CRIMINAL LAWS (BACK TOTOP)

FINE GAEL IN GOVERNMENT SET ABOUT A MAJOR REFORM OF OUR 
CRIMINAL LAW. WE TOOK THE TIME TO IDENTIFY WEAKNESSES AND THEN 
ACTED DECISIVELY TO ELIMINATE THOSE PROBLEMS AND TILT THE BALANCE 
OF OUR LAWS IN FAVOUR OF THE VICTIMS OF CRIME AND THOSE WHO 
UPHOLD THOSE LAWS. FINE GAEL  ENACTED LEGISLATION WHICH : 

 ALLOWED FOR THE DETENTION FOR QUESTIONING OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS FOR 
UP TO SEVEN DAYS AND RESTRICTED THE RIGHT TO  SILENCE IN DRUG 
TRAFFICKING CASES. 

 INTRODUCED NEW MEASURES TO TACKLE THE  PROBLEMS OF DELAYS IN 
THE COURTS,  INCLUDING THE APPOINTMENT OF ADDITIONAL  JUDGES. BY 
MAY 1997, 24 EXTRA JUDGES  HAVE BEEN PROVIDED FOR BY 
LEGISLATION, A  25% INCREASE ON 1994 LEVELS. 

 GIVEN THE GARDAI NEW POWERS TO SEARCH  FOR EVIDENCE RELATING TO 
SERIOUS  OFFENCES SUCH AS MURDER AND RAPE,  EXTENDED THE PERIOD 
FOR WHICH A PERSON  MAY BE REMANDED IN CUSTODY, PROVIDED  FOR 
THE GIVING OF CERTAIN GARDA EVIDENCE  BY CERTIFICATE AND PERMITS 
THE USE OF  "STINGERS" TO TACKLE THE CRIME OF JOY  RIDING. 

 PROVIDED FOR STRONGER MEASURES AGAINST  SYRINGE OFFENCES, 
STALKING AND  COMBATING DRUG ABUSE IN LICENSED  PREMISES. 

  BAIL REFERENDUM

WE INTRODUCED THE BAIL REFERENDUM WHICH WAS PASSED BY THE 
PEOPLE. THIS MEANS THAT THE SCANDAL OF CONVICTED CRIMINALS 
COMMITTING CRIME WHILE ON BAIL WAS FINALLY TACKLED. THE 
GOVERNMENT  ALSO REFORMED OUR LAWS TO ENSURE THAT BAIL MONEY 
WILL BE COLLECTED.
  
CRIMINAL ASSETS BUREAU

THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED THE CRIMINAL ASSETS 
BUREAU. THIS PUT A MULTI-AGENCY APPROACH TO TACKLING CRIME ON A 
STATUTORY BASIS - INCLUDING PRO-ACTIVE TARGETED MEASURES BY THE 
GARDAI, THE REVENUE COMMISSIONERS AND SOCIAL WELFARE. THE 
BUREAU CAN REQUEST THE HIGH COURT TO FREEZE AND ULTIMATELY 
DISPOSE OF PROPERTY WHICH IT IS SATISFIED, ON THE BALANCE OF 
PROBABILITIES, IS THE PROCEEDS OF CRIME. 

  PUBLISHED BILLS

FINE GAEL IN GOVERNMENT PUBLISHED SEVERAL OTHER IMPORTANT 
CRIME-FIGHTING BILLS INCLUDING BILLS TO DEAL WITH JUVENILE JUSTICE 
AND CHILD PORNOGRAPHY. 

 SUMMARY  (BACK TO TOP)

FINE GAEL IN GOVERNMENT FROM 1994 TO 1997 PROVIDED 25% 
MORE JUDGES, RESTRICTED THE RIGHT TO SILENCE, ESTABLISHED THE 
CRIMINALS ASSETS BUREAU TO RELENTLESSLY PURSUE CRIMINALS' ASSETS, 
REFORMED OUR BAIL LAWS, SUPPORTED OPERATION DOCHAS TO ELIMINATE 
DRUG PUSHERS FROM OUR STREETS, STREAMLINED THE COURTS SYSTEM AND 
PROVIDED FOR SEVEN-DAY DETENTION OF SUSPECTED DRUG TRAFFICKERS.
   
2. REFORM OF OUR PENAL SYSTEM  (BACK TO TOP)

THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT PUT IN PLACE A MAJOR PRISON BUILDING 
PROGRAMME, EACH PLANK OF WHICH WAS COMPLETED DURING THE 29 
MONTH PERIOD OF GOVERNMENT. THIS GOVERNMENT'S PRISON 
BUILDING PROGRAMME HAS PROVIDED 800 EXTRA PRISON SPACES, AN 
INCREASE OF 36%: 

 A NEW 400 PLACE REMAND PRISON AT  WHEATFIELD HAS BEEN BUILT 
AND WILL BE  READY FOR USE BY NEXT YEAR.
 177 PLACES IN CASTLEREA.
 60 PLACES IN MOUNTJOY WOMENS' PRISON.
  55 PLACES IN LIMERICK
100 PLACES IN THE CURRAGH. 

THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT  ALSO ESTABLISHED A NEW PRISONS 
AGENCY TO MANAGE OUR PRISONS.

  SUMMARY

FINE GAEL IN GOVERNMENT TOOK UNPRECEDENTED STEPS TO END THE 
YEARS OF NEGLECT OF OUR PRISONS. WE EMBARKED ON THE MOST 
AMBITIOUS PRISON BUILDING PROGRAMME SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF THE 
STATE. THE PROGRAMME SAW AN ADDITIONAL 800 PRISON SPACES 
PROVIDED AT A COST OF £73M. AND REPRESENTS AN INCREASE OF 36% IN 
THE NUMBER OF PRISON SPACES. WE ALSO ESTABLISHED AN 
INDEPENDENT PRISONS AGENCY TO MANAGE OUR PRISONS. FINE GAEL IN 
GOVERNMENT  DELIVERED ON PRISON REFORM.

3. IMPROVEMENTS IN THE GARDA SÍOCHÁNA (BACK TO TOP)

FINE GAEL ACTED DECISIVELY TO DEVELOP AND MODERNISE THE GARDAI. 
FINE GAEL : 

 PROVIDED FOR THE RECRUITMENT OF 2,500  MORE GARDAI, FIFTEEN 
HUNDRED OF WHOM HAVE BEEN RECRUITED  AND RECRUITMENT OF THE 
REMAINDER WILL COMMENCE NEXT MONTH. 

 FREED UP MORE GARDAI TO FIGHT CRIME ON  THE STREETS BY 
ADDRESSING THE AMOUNT OF  GARDA OVERTIME IN THE DUBLIN AREA  
(EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT 200 FULL-TIME  GARDAI) WHICH WAS TAKEN UP 
WAITING IN  THE COURTS FOR CASES TO BE HEARD WHERE  THEY HAD TO 
PRESENT DOCUMENTARY  EVIDENCE. 

 MORE CIVILIANS WERE EMPLOYED TO  REPLACE DESK BOUND GARDAI. 

 COMMENCED INVESTMENT OF £36M IN  IMPROVING GARDA 
TECHNOLOGY. THE  ADVANCES IN THIS AREA ARE OBVIOUS AND  STARK. 
FOR EXAMPLE IN 1994, IT TOOK  30,000 MINUTES TO MANUALLY 
IDENTIFY  FINGERPRINTS; THROUGH THE PROVISION OF  STATE-OF-THE-ART 
TECHNOLOGY IT NOW TAKES  10 MINUTES. 

 APPROVED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A GARDA  AIR SUPPORT UNIT, 
INCLUDING THE PURCHASE  OF A HELICOPTER AND FIXED-WING AIRCRAFT  
WHICH ARE DUE TO BE DELIVERED VERY  SHORTLY. 

 INSTALLED CLOSED-CIRCUIT TV CAMERAS IN  DUBLIN TO ASSIST THE 
GARDAI IN REDUCING  CITY CENTRE CRIME. 

 GRANTED THE GARDAI NEW POWERS  RELATING TO THE DETENTION OF 
DRUG  TRAFFICKERS AND SEIZURE OF ASSETS. 

 REGIONALISED THE OPERATIONAL  MANAGEMENT OF THE GARDAI. 

THE GOVERNMENT MADE THE EUROPEAN AND INTERNATIONAL BATTLE 
AGAINST DRUGS AND CRIME A CENTRAL FEATURE OF IRELAND'S EU 
PRESIDENCY. CRIMINALS ARE USING MODERN TECHNOLOGY TO ORGANISE 
THEMSELVES INTERNATIONALLY AND THE SUCCESS OF THE IRISH 
PRESIDENCY HELPED CREATE A EUROPEAN FRAMEWORK THAT CAN COMBAT 
IT EFFECTIVELY.

  SUMMARY

FINE GAEL IN GOVERNMENT PROVIDED FOR THE RECRUITMENT OF 2,500 
MORE GARDAI, INVESTED IN TECHNOLOGY, REDUCED GARDA 
BUREAUCRACY, RE-ORGANISED THE GARDAI, PROVIDED A NEW AIR 
SUPPORT UNIT, GIVING THE GARDAI NEW POWERS AND MADE MAJOR 
INVESTMENT TO CREATE A NEW, MODERN AND EFFECTIVE POLICE FORCE.

 
4. COMBATING DRUGS  (BACK TO TOP)

FINE GAEL IN GOVERNMENT INITIATED A MULTI-AGENCY PLAN TO TACKLE 
THE DRUGS PROBLEM. 

 ESTABLISHED A GARDA NATIONAL DRUGS  UNIT. 

 ESTABLISHED THE CRIMINAL ASSETS  BUREAU. 

 ENACTED THE DRUG TRAFFICKING ACT WHICH  PERMITS DETENTION FOR 
QUESTIONING FOR UP  TO 7 DAYS AND RESTRICTS THE RIGHT TO  SILENCE. 
  
 CHANGED THE LAWS IN RELATION TO DRUG  SEARCHES AT DANCES AND 
DISCOS. 

 CRACKED DOWN ON DRUGS IN PRISONS. 

 ESTABLISHED NEW COMMUNITY TASK  FORCES WITH RESOURCES TO 
TACKLE THE  DEMAND FOR DRUGS IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES. 

 SUPPORTED OPERATION DOCHAS, THE  GARDA ONSLAUGHT AT STREET 
LEVEL ON DRUGS  IN DUBLIN INTRODUCED IN OCTOBER 1996. IN  SIX 
MONTHS IT RESULTED IN £2.6M WORTH OF  DRUGS BEING SEIZED AND 
DRIVEN THE DRUG  PUSHERS OFF THE STREETS. 

 BEGAN A MAJOR MULTI-MEDIA DRUGS  AWARENESS CAMPAIGN AND 
INTRODUCED  DRUG AWARENESS PROGRAMMES IN  PRIMARY SCHOOLS. 

 EXPANDED DRUG TREATMENT SERVICES  INCLUDING ADDITIONAL 
DETOXIFICATION AND  REHABILITATION FACILITIES. 

 GAVE LOCAL AUTHORITIES MORE POWERS TO  EVICT DRUG DEALERS FROM 
ESTATES. 

  SO WHAT WOULD WE DO IN GOVERNMENT? 
(BACK TO TOP)

  OF ALL MATTERS FACING THE GOVERNMENT WHEN IT CAME TO OFFICE, 
THE 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WAS THE MOST NOTABLE ONE WHICH HAD 
CLEARLY SUFFERED NEGLECT OVER RECENT YEARS. THERE HAD BEEN LITTLE 
RECOGNITION OF THE THREAT TO SOCIETY FROM DRUGS; THE NEED FOR A FAR-
REACHING PROGRAMME OF EXTRA PRISON PLACES; THE PROBLEMS FACING 
THE STAFF AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PROSON SERVICE; THE IMPATIENCE 
FELT BY ALL WHO USED THE COURTS; THE THREATS TO THE SAFETY OF OUR 
CHILDREN; THE THREATS PRESENTED BY CHILD PORNOGRAPHY AND THE 
NEED TO REFORM THE OUTDATED MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE OF THE GARDA 
SIOCHANA. A PROGRAMME OF RADICAL REFORM IS WELL UNDERWAY. WE 
RECOGNISE IT HAS SOME WAY TO GO BEFORE THE DAMAGE OF YEARS OF 
INDIFFERENCE CAN BE UNDONE. WE DO NOT TOLERATE CRIME OR CRIMINAL 
ACTIVITY FROM WHATEVER SOURCE, AND WE HAVE BY OUR ACTIONS 
DEMONSTRATED THAT WE DON'T. THE FIRST REQUIREMENT OF OUR 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS THAT IT PROTECTS OUR PEOPLE FROM CRIME. 
THIS REQUIRES ACTION IN REGARD TO THE LAW AND BY EACH ARM OF THE 
JUSTICE SYSTEM - POLICE, COURTS AND PRISONS. 

 1.PROPOSED CHANGES IN THE LAW (BACK TO
 TOP)  
FINE GAEL WANTS THE COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM IT HAS 
ADVANCED IN GOVERNMENT TO BE COMPLETED, INCLUDING MAJOR PIECES 
OF LEGISLATION SUCH AS THE FRAUD BILL, THE INSANITY BILL AND 
CHARITIES LEGISLATION.

 NEW RESTRICTIONS ON THE RIGHT TO  SILENCE 

IN THE CASE OF VERY SERIOUS OFFENCES FINE GAEL WANTS TO CHANGE 
THE LAW, SUBJECT TO PUTTING IN PLACE APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS, TO 
PERMIT THE COURTS TO DRAW INFERENCES ABOUT UNREASONABLE FAILURES 
TO VOLUNTEER INFORMATION TO THE GARDAI.

 EXTENDED DETENTION PERIODS FOR  MURDER SUSPECTS 

WE FAVOUR THE INTRODUCTION OF 48-HOUR DETENTION FOR ALL MURDER 
CRIMES AND NOT JUST THOSE INVOLVING THE USE OF FIREARMS. AT 
PRESENT, DETENTION FOR UP TO 48 HOURS, CAN ONLY BE USED WHERE A 
FIREARM WAS USED IN THE COMMISSIONING OF THE CRIME. 

 LIFETIME SUPERVISION OF CONVICTED  SEX OFFENDERS 

INCARCERATION OF SEX OFFENDERS IS NOT ALWAYS SUFFICIENT TO PROTECT 
VICTIMS BECAUSE REHABILITATION PROGRAMMES ARE NOT ALWAYS 
SUCCESSFUL AND, UPON RELEASE, THERE CAN BE A HIGH PROBABILITY OF 
RE-OFFENDING. THE CRIME OF PAEDOPHILIA IS A PARTICULARLY VILE 
CRIME PERPETRATED ON THE MOST INNOCENT OF VICTIMS. 

FIEN GAEL BELIEVES THAT THE COURTS SHOULD BE GIVEN THE POWER TO 
IMPOSE RIGID LIFETIME SUPERVISION OF CONVICTED SEX OFFENDERS 
AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THEIR SENTENCES. THIS SUPERVISORY 
FUNCTION  WOULD BE UNDERTAKEN BY AN ENLARGED PROBATION 
SERVICE. IT IS ALSO  IMPORTANT, WE BELIEVE, THAT ALL RELEVANT 
AUTHORITIES ARE INFORMED  OF THE WHEREABOUTS OF CONVICTED SEX 
OFFENDERS.

GREATER USE OF COMMUNITY SERVICE ORDERS, ATTACHMENT OF 
EARNINGS, ON-THE-SPOT FINES, ETC. 
FINE GAEL WILL EXPLORE WAYS TO REDUCE LEGAL AND OTHER  RESTRAINTS 
ON THE GREATER USE OF COMMUNITY SERVICE ORDERS WHERE THE 
COURTS DECIDE THIS FORM OF PUNISHMENT WOULD FIT THE AND WOULD 
BE A MORE EFFECTIVE AND  EFFICIENT USE OF THE CONSIDERABLE 
RESOURCES PROVIDED TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE, 
UNDER CURRENT LEGISLATION,  OFFENDERS HAVE TO CONSENT TO SUCH 
ORDERS INSTEAD OF  IMPRISONMENT.

FINE GAEL WILL INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO ENCOURAGE THE GREATER USE 
OF ATTACHMENT OF EARNINGS FOR CIVIL DEBT AND NON-PAYMENT OF 
FINES. WE WILL PROVIDE EVERY OPPORTUNITY FOR THE USE OF THESE 
METHODS AS ALTERNATIVES TO IMPRISONING THE DEFAULTER

FINE GAEL IS EXAMINING WAYS IN WHICH ON-THE-SPOT FINES COULD 
BE USED MORE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN RELATION TO MOTORING/ROAD TRAFFIC 
OFFENCES, PUBLIC ORDER OFFENCES, ETC. 

 NEW ANNUAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE BILLS 

GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT EFFICIENCIES AND SAVINGS FACILITATED BY THE 
NEW COURT AND GARDA PROCEDURES INTRODUCED INTO LAW IN 1997 
AND THE IMPORTANT NEW CRIME-FIGHTING TOOLS NOW AVAILABLE, FINE 
GAEL PROPOSES BUILDING ON THIS SUCCESS BY PUTTING IN PLACE A NEW 
SYSTEM WHEREBY AN ANNUAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE BILL IS BROUGHT 
FORWARD, WITH PARLIAMENTARY DEADLINES AKIN TO THE ANNUAL 
FINANCE AND SOCIAL WELFARE BILLS DEADLINES, TO PROMOTE ONGOING 
IDENTIFIED EFFICIENCIES IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM 
AND CONSTANT UPDATING OF CRIME-FIGHTING TOOLS.

IN ADDITION, THE CRIMINAL LAW ADVISORY GROUP, WHICH WAS 
ESTABLISHED BY FINE GAEL IN GOVERNMENT, SHOULD EVALUATE 
PROPOSALS FROM PRACTITIONERS IN THIS AREA WITH A VIEW TO INCLUDING 
MEASURES IN THE ANNUAL BILL. 

 IDENTIFICATION PARADES 

FINE GAEL PROPOSES THAT WAYS IN WHICH IDENTIFICATION PARADES 
COULD BE MADE MORE "VICTIM-FRIENDLY" WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE 
RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED. 

 CONSISTENCY IN SENTENCING 

FINE GAEL BELIEVES THAT THE ISSUE OF CONSISTENCY IN SENTENCING BY 
THE COURTS NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED. THIS COMPLEX CONSTITUTIONAL 
ISSUE WILL REQUIRE TAKING ACCOUNT OF ALL INTERESTED PARTIES, 
INCLUDING, REPRESENTATIVES OF WOMENS' GROUPS, THE RECENT REPORT 
BY THE LAW REFORM COMMISSION AND THE VIEWS OF THE CRIME 
COUNCIL.

  PROPOSALS ON DRUG-RELATED CRIME  (BACK TO
TOP)

 SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS ON TACKLING THE SOURCES OF SUPPLY AND USE 
OF DRUGS HAS BEEN MADE. WE BUILD ON THIS PROGRESS IN SECURE OUR 
STREETS FROM DRUGS 

 BUILDING COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS 

THE ROLE OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN TACKLING THE DRUGS SCOURGE WILL 
BE ADVANCED THROUGH ENHANCING PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE 
AGENCIES. WE WILL BUILD ON THE LOCAL DRUGS TASK FORCES BEING 
SET UP AS A RESULT OF THE FIRST REPORT OF THE MINISTERIAL TASK 
FORCE ON MEASURES TO REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR DRUGS. WE FAVOUR 
CONTINUING TO DIRECT FUNDS TO DEMAND REDUCTION AND LOCAL 
INITIATIVES, SUCH AS THE £14M ASSIGNED TO THIS AREA IN OCTOBER LAST 
YEAR AND THE DECISION TO USE MONIES DERIVED FROM SEIZED 
CRIMINALS' ASSETS FOR DEMAND - REDUCTION PROGRAMMES.

 PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TREATMENT  FACILITIES 

FINE GAEL AFFIRMS ITS COMMITMENT TO DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAMMES 
AND PLEDGES TO KEEP THE ADEQUACY OF EXISTING RESOURCES UNDER 
CONSTANT REVIEW. IN PARTICULAR, FINE GAEL WILL BUILD ON ITS RECORD 
IN GOVERNMENT OF EXTENDING OUT-PATIENT DETOXIFICATION AND 
ASSESSMENT, IN-PATIENT DETOXIFICATION BEDS, RESIDENTIAL 
DOWNSTREAM BEDS, METHADONE MAINTENANCE PROGRAMMES 
(INCLUDING INCREASED INVOLVEMENT OF GPS), PROVISION OF 
ADDITIONAL MOBILE-TREATMENT UNITS, ETC. 

 REHABILITATION AND JOB  OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADDICTS WHO HAVE  
SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED TREATMENT  PROGRAMMES 

METHADONE MAINTENANCE IS A MEANS TO AN END, BUT A VITAL ONE, IN 
THAT THE STABILISATION IT BRINGS TO DRUG ADDICTS ALLOWS THEM TO BE 
INTRODUCED TO A RANGE OF LONGER-TERM TREATMENTS AND SOLUTIONS 
INCLUDING DETOXIFICATION, REHABILITATION AND GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT. 
IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT OUR METHADONE MAINTENANCE PROGRAMMES 
LEAD TO THESE LONGER-TERM SOLUTIONS, WE MUST ENSURE THAT 
MEANINGFUL FOLLOW-THROUGH OPTIONS ARE IN PLACE. THOSE ADDICTS 
WHO ARE PREPARED TO DO WHAT IT TAKES TO WALK AWAY FROM DRUGS 
AND THE MISERY IT BRINGS TO THEIR FAMILIES AND THE VICTIMS OF THE 
CRIMES THEY COMMIT TO FEED THEIR HABIT SHOULD BE HELPED. 

 ESTABLISH DRUG-FREE UNITS AND DRUG  TREATMENT UNITS IN ALL 
PRISONS 

 DRUG-FREE UNITS AND DRUG TREATMENT UNITS WILL BE ESTABLISHED 
IN ALL PRISONS. THE SUCCESS OF THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT IN THIS 
AREA CLEARLY WARRANTS THE EXTENSION OF THIS PROGRAMME 
THROUGHOUT THE PRISON SERVICE.

 BUILD A CUSTODIAL TREATMENT FACILITY  FOR DRUG USERS 

WE WILL IMMEDIATELY COMMENCE PLANNING THE CONSTRUCTION OF A  
DEDICATED FACILITY ON A SITE NEAR DUBLIN FOR THE CUSTODIAL TREATMENT 
OF DRUG USERS. THE COST OF THIS TYPE OF CUSTODIAL SENTENCE COULD 
BE UP TO 30% LESS THAN SENDING ADDICTS TO JAIL. THE CAPITAL COST OF 
THIS FACILITY WILL BE KEPT TO A MINIMUM BY ADAPTING ANY EXISTING 
SUITABLE BUILDING.

 GIVING COURTS GREATER DISCRETION 

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE NEW DRUGS CUSTODIAL FACILITY, FINE GAEL 
BELIEVES THAT THE COURTS SHOULD BE GIVEN DISCRETION TO EITHER JAIL 
PERSONS CONVICTED OF DRUG RELATED OFFENCES OR TO SEND THEM FOR 
CUSTODIAL TREATMENT TO THIS NEW FACILITY.

  POLICING FOR A SAFER SOCIETY (BACK TO TOP)
 
 FOCUSING ON THE JOB OF POLICING 

WE INCREASED THE GARDA BUDGET BY 16% IN ONLY TWO AND A HALF 
YEARS. WE  ALSO FREED UP GARDA TIME BY, FOR EXAMPLE, INCREASING 
THE NUMBER OF CIVILIANS DOING CLERICAL WORK, REORGANISING AND 
STREAMLINING THE FORCE AND CUTTING THE TIME GARDAI HAVE TO SPEND 
IN COURT. THE SMI REVIEW OF AN GARDA SIOCHANA - THE FIRST 
SINCE THE 1979 LOUDE REPORT ALMOST 20 YEARS AGO - AND THE 
PUBLIC SERVICE MANAGEMENT ACT, WHEN IMPLEMENTED, WILL 
CONTINUE THE FOCUS OF ENSURING THE GARDAI CONCENTRATE ON 
POLICING. FINE GAEL WILL CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT THE GARDAI ARE 
ADEQUATELY RESOURCED AND THAT THEY CAN CONCENTRATE ON THE JOB 
THEY ARE MEANT TO DO - POLICING FOR A SAFER SOCIETY. 

 PROVIDE THE GARDAI WITH MORE  TECHNOLOGY  

THE GARDAI SHOULD CONTINUE TO GET TECHNOLOGICAL ASSISTANCE TO 
FIGHT CRIME. WE HAVE PROVED ALREADY THAT WE DELIVER IN THIS AREA 
AND WE ARE DETERMINED THAT NO CRIMINAL WILL ESCAPE PROSECUTION 
BECAUSE THEY POSSESS MORE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY THAN THE 
GARDAI. WE ARE PARTICULARLY COMMITTED TO THE USE OF CCTV AND 
BELIEVE THAT THEY PROVIDE A USEFUL ADJUNCT TO GARDAI "ON THE 
BEAT". 

 MORE COMMUNITY POLICING 

GARDA COMMUNITY OUTREACH ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE ENHANCED AND WE 
WANT TO SEE, IN PARTICULAR, A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF 
GARDAI ASSIGNED TO COMMUNITY POLICING AND A HEIGHTENED 
AWARENESS OF THIS SERVICE WITHIN THE GARDAI AND COMMUNITIES 
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

 ESTABLISH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND  SEXUAL ASSAULT UNITS IN GARDA  
REGIONS 

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT UNITS SHOULD BE 
ESTABLISHED IN ALL FIVE OF THE GARDA REGIONS OUTSIDE DUBLIN 
(WHICH ALREADY HAS ONE) IN A PRIORITISATION OF MEASURES TO HELP 
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VIOLENT CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN.

 ESTABLISH LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS  AGAINST CRIME 

WE WILL ESTABLISH, ON A PILOT BASIS INITIALLY, OF A NUMBER OF LOCAL-
AREA PARTNERSHIPS AGAINST CRIME TO BE LOCATED IN SELECTED AREAS 
THROUGHOUT IRELAND. THE PARTNERSHIPS WOULD CO-ORDINATE THE 
WORK OF THE VARIOUS AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY GROUPS WITH AN 
INTEREST IN TACKLING CRIME AND PROVIDE A "ONE-STOP SHOP" FOR 
FAMILIES UNDER STRESS DUE TO THE PERSISTENT CYCLE OF POVERTY, 
CRIME, DRUGS AND VIOLENCE THAT PREVAILS IN MANY OF OUR 
DISADVANTAGED AREAS. LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS AGAINST CRIME WOULD 
WORK IN CLOSE CO-OPERATION WITH LOCAL DRUGS STRATEGY TEAMS. 

 ESTABLISH A CIVIC WARDENS' FORCE 

FINE GAEL WANTS TO INTRODUCE CIVIC WARDENS, MODELLED ON THE 
SUCCESSFUL DUTCH STREETWATCHERS SCHEME, TO SUPPLEMENT AND 
SUPPORT THE WORK OF THE GARDAI. WE WANT TO CONSULT WITH WELL-
ESTABLISHED AND VALUED VOLUNTARY AND COMMUNITY ORGANISATIONS 
SUCH AS COMMUNITY ALERT AND NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCH IN 
ESTABLISHING THE SERVICE. SUITABLE TRAINING SHOULD BE PROVIDED 
AND WIDESPREAD CONSULTATION SHOULD BE INITIATED WITH THE GARDAI 
AND LOCAL COMMUNITY GROUPS PRIOR TO THE LAUNCH OF THE SCHEME. 

IN THE RURAL CONTEXT, THE WARDENS COULD REGULARLY CHECK ON 
ELDERLY PEOPLE LIVING ALONE WHO MIGHT BE AT RISK FROM CRIMINALS. 
WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE WITH SUITABLE TRAINING TO UTILISE 
THE COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT SCHEME AS THE VEHICLE FOR 
EMPLOYING THE WARDENS. 

  THE COURTS  (BACK TO TOP)

FINE GAEL  SPEARHEADED AND IMPLEMENTED SOME OF THE MOST FAR-
REACHING REFORMS OF OUR COURTS SINCE THEY WERE ESTABLISHED 
SHORTLY AFTER INDEPENDENCE. WE ARE DETERMINED THAT CASES BE 
DEALT WITH AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND THAT THE COURTS ARE RUN 
EFFICIENTLY.  

THEREFORE, WE FAVOUR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT 
COURTS SERVICE TO STREAMLINE THE BUSINESS OF THE COURTS AND 
ACHIEVE A MORE EFFICIENT DISPATCH OF CRIMINALS FROM OUR STREETS. 
THE DRAFTING OF THE LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH THE COURTS SERVICE IS 
AT AN ADVANCED .

   THE PRISON SYSTEM (BACK TO TOP)

PRISONERS MUST SERVE THEIR TIME. THE SO-CALLED "REVOLVING DOOR" 
IN RESPECT OF ROUTINE TEMPORARY OR EARLY RELEASE MUST BE STOPPED. 
THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT RESPONDED TO THIS NEED THROUGH A 
MAJOR PRISON PLACES' PROGRAMME. 

IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE NEVER HAVE A SHORTAGE OF PRISON PLACES 
AGAIN, FINE GAEL BELIEVES THAT PRISON ACCOMODATION NEEDS SHOULD 
BE KEPT UNDER CONSTANT REVIEW. WE PROPOSE:

BUILD A NEW 400 PLACE PRISON

BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR 2000, WE PLAN TO HAVE CONSTRUCTED A  
NEW 400-PLACE SECURE PRISON. WE WILL INVITE THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO  
PARTICIPATE IN THE DESIGN, BUILDING AND FINANCING OF THE PROJECT IN  
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE

 ESTABLISHMENT OF A PRISONS' AGENCY 

AN INDEPENDENT PRISONS' AGENCY WILL NOW BE SET UP TO MANAGE 
OUR PRISONS MORE EFFECTIVELY. A DETAILED REPORT HAS ALREADY BEEN 
PREPARED BY AN EXPERT GROUP ESTABLISHED BY FINE GAEL IN 
GOVERNMENT AND THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT HAS APPROVED ITS 
RECOMMENDATIONS. THE AGENCY WILL ALSO SET STRICT PERFORMANCE 
TARGETS IN TERMS OF SOUND CUSTODIAL PRACTICES AND COST CONTROL.

 EXPAND THE PROBATION AND WELFARE  SERVICES 

THE PROBATION AND WELFARE SERVICE SHOULD BE EXPANDED 
SIGNIFICANTLY TO ENSURE THAT IT CAN MEET THE INCREASING DEMANDS 
BEING MADE ON IT. THIS SHOULD INCLUDE LIFETIME SUPERVISION OF SEX 
OFFENDERS. THE PROVISION OF PROBATION SERVICE HOSTELS ACTS AS A 
"HALF WAY" HOME FOR OFFENDERS AND PERMITS MORE EFFECTIVE 
MANAGEMENT OF OFFENDERS BY THE SERVICE. THE COST IS ABOUT A 
THIRD OF MAINTAINING A PERSON IN PRISON. FINE GAEL COMMITS ITSELF 
TO EXPANDING THIS OPTION AND, IN PARTICULAR, TO THE PROVISION OF 
ADEQUATE HOSTEL ACCOMMODATION FOR WOMEN OFFENDERS. 

 GREATER SAVINGS IN PRISON OPERATING  COSTS 

THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRISON OPERATING COSTS REVIEW 
GROUP ARE EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE SHORTLY. FINE GAEL WILL  
IMPLEMENT, AS QUICKLY AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE,OF  ANY 
COST-SAVING RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THIS GROUP MAKES SO THAT 
VALUE FOR MONEY CAN BE ACHIEVED IN THE RUNNING OF OUR PRISONS.

  SUPPORTING VICTIMS OF CRIME (BACK TO TOP)

FINE GAEL'S TRACK RECORD ON SUPPORTING VICTIMS IS UNPRECEDENTED. 
IN 29 MONTHS, WE : 

 PUBLISHED THE FIRST EVER VICTIMS CHARTER.
  FUNDED THE REVIEW OF THE LEGAL PROCESS  REGARDING SEXUAL AND 
OTHER CRIMES OF  VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN
GAVE THE FIRST EVER STATE FUNDING TO  COMMUNITY ALERT. 
 GAVE TWO AND A HALF TIMES MORE FUNDING
 TO VICTIM SUPPORT IN 1997 THAN ONLY 2  YEARS AGO. 
 ADVANCED A DISCUSSION PAPER ON  SEXUAL OFFENCES TO THE POINT 
WHERE IT IS  CLOSE TO PUBLICATION BY THE DEPARTMENT  OF JUSTICE, 
INCLUDING A THOROUGH  EXAMINATION OF THE ISSUE OF LEGAL  
REPRESENTATION FOR VICTIMS. 

 LEGAL REPRESENTATION 

FINE GAEL WANTS TO SEE THIS SUCCESS BUILT UPON. ONCE THE 
DISCUSSION PAPER ON SEXUAL OFFENCES IS PUBLISHED AND 
DISCUSSED, FINE GAEL WILL SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS IN FAVOUR OF 
A FAIR, EQUITABLE AND BALANCED SYSTEM FOR VICTIMS OF CRIME WHO 
REQUIRE LEGAL ADVICE, PARTICULARLY IN CASES OF SEXUAL OFFENCE. 

 RESTITUTION FUND 

FINE GAEL WOULD ESTABLISH, BY LAW, A RESTITUTION FUND TO WHICH 
OFFENDERS WILL CONTRIBUTE AND THIS FUND WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THE 
BENEFIT OF VICTIMS TO COMPENSATE THEM FOR THE TRAUMA VISITED 
UPON THEM BY THE CRIMES OF OTHERS.

 CRIMINALS TO PRODUCE STATEMENT OF  THEIR ASSETS 

ALL PERSONS CONVICTED OF CRIMES AGAINST PEOPLE AND PROPERTY WILL 
BE OBLIGED TO MAKE A FULL STATEMENT OF THEIR ASSETS TOGETHER WITH 
ALL THEIR SOURCES OF INCOME, WHICH MAY BE USED FOR THE BENEFIT OF 
THE VICTIMS OF THE CRIME.

 GIVE VICTIMS MORE STATUTORY RIGHTS 

THE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF VICTIMS WILL BE ENHANCED BY: 

 REGISTERING THEMSELVES AS A VICTIM OF  CRIME. 
 ENTITLEMENT TO A STATEMENT OF ASSETS AND  SOURCES OF INCOME OF 
THE PERPETRATOR. 
 VICTIM NOTIFICATION IF THE CRIMINAL ASSETS  BUREAU SEIZES THE 
ASSETS OF THE CRIMINAL  IN QUESTION SO THAT THE VICTIM CAN MAKE  AN 
APPLICATION FOR ACCESS TO THOSE  FUNDS. 

  CRIME PREVENTION STRATEGIES (BACK TO TOP)
 
 ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT CRIME  COUNCIL 

IN KEEPING WITH THE RECENTLY PUBLISHED DISCUSSION PAPER 
"TACKLING CRIME", FINE GAEL BELIVES AN INDEPENDENT CRIME 
COUNCIL SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED AS A SOURCE OF STRATEGIC POLICY 
OPTIONS AND A FORUM FOR DEBATE ON CRIME ISSUES. 

 IMPROVED RESEARCH 

AN ENHANCED RESEARCH BUDGET ON CRIME AND RELATED MATTERS 
SHOULD BE SECURED AND THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING THIS ADMINISTERED 
BY, OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH, THE CRIME COUNCIL, UNIVERSITIES AND 
OTHER INDEPENDENT BODIES SHOULD BE EXAMINED.

 CRIME AWARENESS PROGRAMMES IN  SCHOOLS 

CRIME AWARENESS PROGRAMMES IN SCHOOLS SHOULD BE INITIATED 
INVOLVING "REALITY THERAPY" SESSIONS TO EXPOSE CHILDREN (WITH 
PARENTAL CONSENT) TO THE REALITY BEHIND CRIME AND ANTI-SOCIAL 
BEHAVIOUR - THE IMPACT ON VICTIMS, THE CONSEQUENCES FOR SOCIETY 
AND THE CRIMINAL AND THE NEED FOR COMMUNITY SPIRIT AND CARE.
  
 IMPROVED CRIME STATISTICS 

THE QUALITY AND SCOPE OF CRIME-RELATED STATISTICS SHOULD BE 
IMPROVED THROUGH GREATER RESOURCING AND THE EXTENDED USE OF 
MODERN TECHNOLOGY. 

 MAJOR EXPANSION OF YOUTH DIVERSION  SCHEMES 

YOUTH DIVERSION SCHEMES ARE PARTICULARLY SUCCESSFUL IN DIVERTING 
YOUNG PEOPLE AWAY FROM CRIME (AGED 8 TO 16) WHO ARE ALREADY 
SEEN TO BE AT RISK OF FALLING INTO A LIFE OF CRIME. 

IN GOVERNMENT, FINE GAEL INCREASED THE NUMBER OF YOUTH 
DIVERSION SCHEMES FROM 4 IN 1994 TO 11 IN 1997. THESE 
SCHEMES NOW OPERATE IN DUBLIN, CORK, LIMERICK, WATERFORD AND 
DUNDALK. 

FINE GAEL CALLS FOR THE EXPANSION OF YOUTH DIVERSION SCHEMES 
ON A NATION-WIDE BASIS. 

 GARDA LIAISON SCHEME FOR ADULTS 

A SCHEME EQUIVALENT TO THE GARDA JUVENILE LIAISON SCHEME 
AIMED AT DIVERTING ADULTS AWAY FROM CRIME SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED. 
THIS NEW SCHEME SHOULD BE PUT ON A STATUTORY FOOTING AS THE 
JUVENILE JUSTICE BILL PROPOSES FOR THE JUVENILE LIAISON SCHEME.

  SUMMARY (BACK TO TOP)

FINE GAEL DOES NOT JUST TALK ABOUT TAKING ON THE CRIMINAL - WE DO 
IT. WE ARE THE PARTY THAT  PROVIDED FOR THE RECRUITMENT OF 2,500 
MORE GARDAI, PROVIDING 800 MORE PRISON SPACES AND 24 EXTRA 
JUDGES. IN GOVERNMENT WE ESTABLISHED THE CRIMINAL ASSETS 
BUREAU TO RELENTLESSLY PURSUE DRUG CRIMINALS AND TO SEIZE 
CRIMINAL ASSETS AND PUT THE "CRIME BOSSES" UNDER PRESSURE. WE 
ARE THE PARTY WHO PROVIDED THE GARDAI WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY TO 
TAKE ON AND BEAT THE CRIMINALS. WE ARE THE PARTY WHO ENDED THE 
YEARS OF NEGLECT. 


ENVIRONEMNT

  POLICIES ON THE ENVIRONMENT

 OUR PHILOSOPHY
   OUR PHILOSOPHY  (BACK TO TOP)

FINE GAEL BELIEVES THE GREATEST THREAT TO OUR EXPECTATION OF  
CONTINUED PROSPERITY COULD ARISE FROM THE CONSEQUENCES  FOR OUR 
ENVIRONMENT OF THAT VERY PROSPERITY. BECAUSE OF EU DECISIONS, 
WE FACE THE PROSPECT OF STRICT CO2 EMMISSIONS' QUOTAS BEING 
IMPOSED UPON EACH EU MEMBER STATE. GIVEN THE RELATIVELY HIGH 
GROWTH NOW BEING EXPERIENCED IN OUR ECONOMY WE COULD SUFFER 
PROPORTIONATELY MORE THAN OTHER COUNTRIES FROM THESE CO2 
QUOTAS. FINE GAEL BELIEVES WE MUST DEVELOP THE BEST MEANS 
POSSIBLE TO MEET THESE TARGETS WHILE SECURING OUR RECENT 
EMPLOYMENT AND PROSPERITY ACHIEVEMENTS.

FINE GAEL BELIEVES ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS SHOULD BE  PLACED 
RIGHT AT THE CENTRE OF GOVERNMENT ACTIVITY. THIS  SHOULD BE DONE 
IN A SPIRIT OF PARTNERSHIP WITH ALL  ENVIRONMENTAL INTERESTS. 
SPECIFICALLY, ALL SUCH INTERESTS  SHOULD BE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN 
SOCIAL PARTNERSHIP  DURING THE PREPARATION OF THE NEXT PROGRAMME 
FOR ECONOMIC  AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT.

GIVEN THE BROAD AND CHALLENGING AGENDA WHICH MANAGING  OUR 
ENVIRONMENTAL ENDOWMENTS WILL PRESENT IN THE NEW  
MILLENNIUM, FINE GAEL BELIEVES WE SHOULD ESTABLISH A  MINISTRY 
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE  DEVELOPMENT ("GREEN 
MINISTRY") OF FULL CABINET RANK.

THE AGENDA FOR THIS NEW MINISTRY WILL BE A BROAD ONE. IT WILL 
COVER THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF HOUSEHOLD AND COMMERCIAL 
WASTE. ALREADY IMAGINATIVE INITIATIVES HVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN IN 
THIS AREA OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS OR SO. IT INCLUDES THE GOAL OF 
CLEAN WATER AND AIR. THE PROBLEMS CREATED BY GROWING PRIVATE 
TRAFFIC IN OUR BUILT-UP CENTRES OF POPULATION WILL BECOME 
ESPECIALLY EVIDENT AS OUR ECONOMIC PROSPERITY CONTINUES.
  
WE HAVE TO BE ALSO MINDFUL OF THE WAY WE EXPLOIT OUR NATURAL 
RESOURCES THAT UNDERLIE AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, FISHING AND TOURISM 
SO THAT WE DO NOT DESTROY THEM. MOREOVER WE CONSTANTLY NEED TO 
SEEK WAYS TO REDUCE THE RATE AT WHICH WE DEPLETE OUR FIXED 
SUPPLIES OF EXHAUSTABLE ENERGY RESOURCES. OUR ENVIRONMENT 
PROVIDES US WITH BENEFITS WHICH WE CAN REAP THROUGH ECONOMIC 
MEANS. IT MAKES ECONOMIC SENSE TO CARE FOR THIS RESOURCE. BUT 
WE ALSO DERIVE BENEFITS FROM OUR ENVIRONMENT IN NON-ECONOMIC 
WAYS WHICH ARE NO LESS IMPORTANT. THE MAINTENANCE OF AREA OF 
GREAT NATURAL BEAUTY AND PRESERVES OF ECOLOGICAL DIVERSITY IS 
IMPORTANT.

WE BELIEVE THAT BEYOND THESE ITEMS WHICH WOULD BE ON A 
CONVENTIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGENDA, WE SHOULD ALSOADD ISSUES 
WHICH IMPINGE ON PUBLIC HEALTH SUCH AS ALCOHOL AND DRUG 
(INCLUDING TOBACCO) ABUSE, FOOD SAFETY, AND WIDER ENVIRONMENTAL 
HEALTH RISKS. HOWEVER, WE SEE THESE ISSUES BEST BEING HANDLED 
BY A MINISTER OF STATE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH ATTACHED TO THE 
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

IN A NEW GOVERNMENT WE WILL FOCUS ON ACHIEVING OUR OBJECTIVES 
THROUGH  HEIGHTENING AWARENESS OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AT ALL  
LEVELS IN SOCIETY; IMPLEMENTING EFFECTIVE WASTE  MANAGEMENT 
PRACTICES; INVESTIGATING HOW FISCAL  INSTRUMENTS COULD BE USED TO 
MODIFY BEHAVIOUR; AND BY  PROMOTING POSITIVE MEASURES TO 
PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE  DEVELOPMENT. 

SO WHAT DID WE DO IN GOVERNMENT? (BACK TO TOP)

1. MANAGING OUR WASTE (BACK TO TOP)

THE 1996 WASTE MANAGEMENT ACT ENSURES THAT COMPANIES,  
FARMS AND STATE AGENCIES WHICH GENERATE SIGNIFICANT LEVELS  OF 
WASTE (INCLUDING PACKAGING) WILL BE REQUIRED TO ATTAIN  SPECIFIED 
RECYCLING TARGETS OVER A DESIGNATED TIME PERIOD.  WE TOOK OUR 
COMMITMENTS TO PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT  SERIOUSLY. WE 
LAUNCHED A FAR-SIGHTED PROGRAMME TO  ENCOURAGE WASTE RECOVERY 
THROUGH RECYCLING INITIATIVES.

2. ENCOURAGING RECYCLING (BACK TO TOP)

AMONG THE MEASURES WE PROMOTED WAS A GRANTS SCHEME TO  
ENCOURAGE LOCAL AUTHORITY AND PRIVATE-SECTOR RECYCLING  PROJECTS. 
WE ALSO MOVED TO ELIMINATE THE POLLUTION CAUSED  BY FARM 
PLASTICS THROUGH OBLIGING SUPPLIERS TO OPERATE  "DEPOSIT AND 
REFUND" SCHEMES.

3. DEVELOPING RENEWABLE ENERGY
STRATEGIES (BACK TO TOP)

THE DEVELOPMENT OF SAFE AND RENEWABLE ENERGY STRATEGIES  WAS 
ENTHUSIASTICALLY PURSUED BY THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT  AND A 
CONTRACT FOR THE CONSTRUCTION IN DUBLIN OF A 30MW  POWER STATION 
FIRED BY WASTE MATERIAL WAS AWARDED TO AN  INTERNATIONAL 
CONSORTIUM INVOLVING THE ESB.

4. TAKING ON SELLAFIELD (BACK TO TOP)

IN AN UNPRECEDENTED MOVE THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT  SHOWED 
THE STRENGTH OF ITS OPPOSITION TO THE PROPOSED  DEVELOPMENTS AT 
THE SELLAFIELD NUCLEAR REPROCESSING PLANT  AT CUMBRIA BY BEING 
DIRECTLY REPRESENTED AT THE PUBLIC  INQUIRY IN THE U.K. THE 
SUCCESS OF THIS INTERVENTION IN  STOPPING THE PROPOSED 
UNDERGROUND DUMP, WAS A MAJOR  VICTORY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION, AND SHOWS THE POWER  OF GOVERNMENT TO EFFECT 
CHANGE WHEN THE COMMITMENT IS  CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS.  

5. REBUILDING OUR COUNTY ROADS (BACK TO TOP)

IN 1994, OUR COUNTY ROADS WERE IN A CHRONIC STATE OF  DISREPAIR. 
WE SET ABOUT REBUILDING OUR COUNTY ROAD  NETWORK. IT IS EVIDENT 
TO ALL THAT THE QUALITY OF OUR COUNTY  ROADS IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY 
WHILE FINE GAEL WERE IN  GOVERNMENT. £60 MILLION WAS SPENT IN 
BETWEEN 1996 AND  1997 AND WE HAD COMMITTED OURSELVES TO A 
10-YEAR  PROGRAMME COSTING A TOTAL OF £1,000 MILLION.

6. ABOLITION OF SERVICE CHARGES AND  PROPERTY 
TAX (BACK TO TOP)

ALMOST 700,000 HOUSEHOLDS BENEFITED FROM THE ABOLITION OF  
LOCAL WATER CHARGES REPRESENTING AN ANNUAL AVERAGE SAVING  OF 
£75 PER HOUSEHOLD. WE ALSO SCRAPPED RESIDENTIAL  PROPERTY TAX 
WHICH WAS A TAX ON FAMILY HOMES.

7. SOCIAL HOUSING (BACK TO TOP) 

THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BENEFITING UNDER THE SOCIAL HOUSING  
PROGRAMME INCREASED FROM 1,200 AT THE END OF 1993, TO 3,000  
AT THE END OF 1996. WE ALSO BROUGHT TOTAL HOUSING OUTPUT,  
PRIVATE, VOLUNTARY AND LOCAL AUTHORITY - TO ALL TIME RECORD  LEVELS 
WITH ALMOST 34,000 COMPLETIONS IN 1996.

SO WHAT WOULD WE DO IN GOVERNMENT? (BACK TO
TOP)

1. NEW STRUCTURAL CHANGES (BACK TO TOP)

TO ENSURE AN EVEN MORE FOCUSED RESPONSE FROM  GOVERNMENT TO 
THE ENVIRONMENT, WE BELIEVE A DEPARTMENT  FOR THE ENVIRONMENT 
AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT SHOULD  BE ESTABLISHED.

THIS, TOGETHER WITH THE PROPOSAL ALREADY ANNOUNCED IN OUR  
HEALTH CARE MANIFESTO TO APPOINT A NEW MINISTER OF STATE  FOR 
PUBLIC HEALTH WOULD ENSURE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES  MAINTAIN 
THEIR PLACE AT THE TOP OF THE POLITICAL AGENDA. THE  MINISTER OF 
STATE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH WOULD HAVE  RESPONSIBILITY NOT ONLY FOR 
STRICTLY MEDICAL ISSUES, BUT ALSO  FOR WIDER ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
AS THEY IMPACT ON PUBLIC  HEALTH.

2. PROMOTING GREATER PUBLIC AWARENESS
(BACK TO TOP)

 OBLIGE ORGANISATIONS TO PREPAREENVIRONMENTAL STATEMENTS 

ALL MEDIUM TO LARGE COMPANIES AND RELEVANT STATE BODIES  SHOULD 
BE OBLIGED TO INCORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL STATEMENTS  INTO THEIR 
ANNUAL REPORTS. THESE STATEMENTS WOULD INCLUDE  AS A MINIMUM, 
APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS  RELATING TO WASTE 
PRODUCTION AND DISPOSAL.

 COMPILE BETTER ENVIRONMENT STATISTICS 

ALL STATE AGENCIES WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSEMBLING  STATISTICS 
ON SECTORAL PERFORMANCE SHOULD BE MANDATED TO  COMMENCE 
COMPILATION AND REPORTING OF APPROPRIATE  STATISTICAL INDICATORS ON 
THE ENVIRONMENT AND  SUSTAINABILITY.

 ISO 9000 

THE ISO 9000 STANDARD SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO EMBRACE SAFETY 
AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY STANDARDS AND TARGETS FOR INCREASED 
PARTICIPATION LEVELS SHOULD BE SET FOR EACH YEAR.

 ANANLYSE GOVERNMENT POLICIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT 

WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT IN THE EXAMINATION OF RELEVANT  
GOVERNMENT POLICIES THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE  ENVIRONMENT AND 
SUSTAINABILITY ARE ASSESSED IN THE  DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. 
ALSO, VALUE FOR MONEY  ASSESSMENT OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SHOULD 
CONTAIN, WHERE  RELEVANT, SUITABLE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 
PARAMETERS.

3. BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE WASTE  MANAGEMENT 
(BACK TO TOP)

 IMPLEMENTING EXISTING LAWS 

WE SEEK THE VIGOROUS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 1996 WASTE  
MANAGEMENT ACT WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT COMPANIES, FARMS  AND 
STATE AGENCIES WHICH GENERATE SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF  WASTE 
(INCLUDING PACKAGING) WILL BE REQUIRED TO ATTAIN  SPECIFIED 
RECYCLING TARGETS OVER A DESIGNATED TIME PERIOD.

 DEVELOP DOMESTIC RECYCLING 

LOCAL AUTHORITIES MUST BE OBLIGED TO DEVISE SYSTEMS TO  FACILITATE 
RECYCLING DOMESTIC HOUSEHOLD WASTE. WE BELIEVE  THAT THERE IS 
MERIT IN SUPPLYING ALL HOUSES WITH REFUSE BINS  WHICH CONTAIN 
SEGREGATED COMPARTMENTS FOR THE SORTING OF  HOUSEHOLD RUBBISH. 
THIS WOULD ENABLE MORE COST EFFECTIVE  RECYCLING. TO ESTABLISH 
THE FEASIBILITY OF SUCH A PROJECT, WE  BELIEVE EXTENSIVE PILOTING OF 
THIS PROJECT SHOULD BE  PROMOTED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES ON A 
SUBSIDISED BASIS.

 NEW LEVIES ON NON-RECYCLABLE WASTE 

IN IRELAND FAR TOO MUCH OF OUR SOLID WASTE IS LANDFILLED  RATHER 
THAN RECYCLED OR INCINERATED AND IF PRESENT TRENDS  CONTINUE A 
SERIOUS SHORTAGE OF LANDFILL SITES WILL EMERGE.  THEREFORE, RADICAL 
ACTION MUST BE TAKEN TO REDUCE THE  AMOUNT OF MATERIAL TO BE 
LANDFILLED. FINE GAEL WOULD ASK THE  GREEN TAXATION 
COMMISSION (SEE BELOW) TO DRAW UP  PROPOSALS TO LEVY THE 
CREATION OF WASTE THAT MAY ULTIMATELY  HAVE TO BE LANDFILLED AND TO 
PLACE A SPECIAL PREMIUM ON  MATERIAL THAT IS NOT EASILY RECYCLED. 
THIS WOULD REDUCE THE  PRESSURE ON LANDFILL REQUIREMENTS IN 
ADDITION TO THE OTHER  INITIATIVES TO BE IMPLEMENTED UNDER THE 
WASTE  MANAGEMENT ACT.

ESTABLISH LOCAL-ARE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEES NEAR LANDFILLS 

INEVITABLY, NO MATTER HOW EFFECTIVE ARE THE PENALTIES  IMPOSED ON 
WASTE PRODUCTION, THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE A  REQUIREMENT FOR 
LANDFILLS. THE CHARGES FOR DUMPING MUST BE  SET AT A LEVEL WHICH 
WILL ENSURE THAT THE MOST RIGOROUS  ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS CAN 
BE AFFORDED AND ADHERED TO. 

FINE GAEL FULLY APPRECIATES THAT LANDFILL DUMPS CAN BE  HIGHLY 
CONTROVERSIAL. IT IS OUR INTENTION TO PROVIDE LOCAL  COMMUNITIES 
WITH A MECHANISM WHEREBY THEY WILL BE FULLY  CONSULTED ON AN 
ON-GOING BASIS IN REGARD TO THE  MANAGEMENT OF AND STANDARDS IN 
A LANDFILL OPERATION IN  THEIR LOCALITY. FINE GAEL BELIEVES THE BEST 
WAY OF ENSURING  THIS LEVEL OF CONSULTATION IS FOR LOCAL - AREA 
ENVIRONMENTAL  COMMITTEES TO BE ESTABLISHED IN THE VICINITY OF ALL 
LANDFILLS  SO AS TO GIVE PEOPLE A REAL VOICE IN DECISION MAKING IN 
THE  OPERATION OF THE SITES. IN CONSULTATION WITH THE NEW GREEN  
TAXATION COMMISSION WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSED LANDFILL  
WASTE LEVY SHOULD BE EARMARKED FOR A FUND WHICH CAN BE  USED 
FOR LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS AND FOR  COMPENSATION OF 
HOUSEHOLDS IN THE VICINITY OF LANDFILL  SITES. THE BASIS FOR THIS 
WOULD BE DETERMINED BY THE LOCAL  AREA ENVIRONMENTAL 
COMMITTEES.

4. INVESTIGATE NEW PRO-ENVIRONMENT FISCAL
MEASURES TO PENALISE WASTE (BACK TO TOP)

ONE OF OUR KEY AIMS IS TO REDUCE SUBSTANTIALLY THE TAXES  LEVIED 
ON LABOUR. BY MOVING TO TAX WASTE AND NOT WORK WE  CAN 
ENHANCE THE TAKE-HOME GAINS FOR WORKERS. FINE GAEL  BELIEVES 
THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY FOR INDIVIDUALS AND  COMMERCIAL CONCERNS 
TO REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS  ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION 
AND CONSUMPTION IS FOR THESE  COSTS TO BE ASSIGNED AN EXPLICIT 
PRICE THROUGH THE  DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ENVIRONMENTAL TAXES. WE 
ARE  COMMITTED TO PENALISING ENVIRONMENTALLY WASTEFUL  PRACTICES 
AND TO USING THE PROCEEDS TO BROADEN THE TAX  BASE AND THUS TO 
REDUCE INCOME TAXES. THIS WOULD ALSO  PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. INTERNATIONAL  COMPETITIVENESS 
CONSIDERATIONS OF COURSE PLACE LIMITS ON  UNILATERAL ACTIONS IN THIS 
AREA AND ACTION CAN EFFECTIVELY BE  UNDERTAKEN ONLY IN 
CONJUNCTION WITH OUR EU PARTNERS.

 ESTABLISH A GREEN TAXATION COMMISSION

FINE GAEL PROPOSES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A GREEN TAXATION  
COMMISSION WHICH WOULD EXAMINE A RANGE OF INCENTIVES  AND 
DISINCENTIVES TO ENSURE THAT OUR ENVIRONMENT IS NOT  DEGRADED AND 
DEVELOPMENT OF OUR NATURAL RESOURCES IS  SUSTAINED.  THE GREEN 
TAXATION COMMISSION WOULD EXAMINE A RANGE OF  FEASIBLE 
ECONOMIC INSTRUMENTS COVERING ISSUES SUCH AS  SOLID AND LIQUID 
WASTE DISPOSAL, HARMFUL EMISSIONS, TRAFFIC  CONGESTION ETC. 

5. PROTECTING OUR MARINE ENVIRONMENT (BACK  TO 
TOP)

WE ARE COMMITTED TO PRESERVING AND PROTECTING THE QUALITY  OF 
IRELAND'S MARINE AND COASTAL ENVIRONMENT, BOTH FOR ITS  INTRINSIC 
VALUE AND AS A BASE FOR INDUSTRIES SUCH AS FISHING,  AQUACULTURE 
AND TOURISM AND LEISURE WHICH ARE CRITICALLY  DEPENDANT ON A HIGH 
QUALITY ENVIRONMENT.

WE GAVE PRACTICAL EXPRESSION TO THIS COMMITMENT THROUGH  A 
RANGE OF INITIATIVES WHICH INCLUDED THE ENACTMENT OF NEW  AND 
MORE EFFECTIVE LEGISLATION TO REGULATE DUMPING AT SEA  (DUMPING 
AT SEA ACT, 1996), INITIATION OF WORK ON A QUALITY  STATUS REPORT 
UNDER THE OSPAR CONVENTION AND ACTIVE  LIAISON WITH UK 
AUTHORITIES ON MUNITIONS DUMPSITES. THIS  PRO-ACTIVE APPROACH 
SHOULD BE MAINTAINED AND FUTURE  INITIATIVES SHOULD INCLUDE THE 
ENACTMENT OF LEGISLATION TO  ENABLE IRELAND RATIFY PROTOCOLS TO 
INTERNATIONAL  CONVENTIONS ON OIL POLLUTION DAMAGE, AND THE 
CONVENTION  ON OIL POLLUTION PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE CO-
OPERATION;  AND PUTTING IN PLACE COMPREHENSIVE PLANS AND 
ADEQUATE  CAPABILITY FOR DEALING WITH SPILLS FROM SHIPS.

 SELLAFIELD 

THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT SHOWED AN OUTSTANDING  COMMITMENT 
TO TAKING ACTION ON SELLAFIELD AND THORP. FINE  GAEL WANTS TO 
ENSURE THAT THIS WORK IS CONTINUED AND  INTENSIFIED.

 IRRADIATED NUCLEAR FUELS 

IRELAND HAS PLAYED A LEADING ROLE WITHIN THE INTERNATIONAL  
MARITIME ORGANISATION IN PRESSING FOR A STRENGTHENING OF  THE 
RULES GOVERNING THE TRANSPORTATION BY SEA OF IRRADIATED  NUCLEAR 
FUELS (THE INF CODE). THE CODE IS OF SPECIAL  IMPORTANCE FOR THIS 
COUNTRY IN VIEW OF OUR PROXIMITY TO  SELLAFIELD, AND THE ACTIVE 
PURSUIT OF THIS MATTER THROUGH  POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS.

 COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT 

WE BELIEVE THAT PRIORITY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE  DEVELOPMENT OF 
INTEGRATED STRATEGIES AND EFFECTIVE  INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR 
COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT,  TAKING ACCOUNT OF A DETAILED 
CONSULTANCY STUDY. WE CALL FOR  PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF A CO-OPERATIVE,  INTEGRATED AND CO-ORDINATED 
APPROACH BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES  AND USERS OF MARINE RESOURCE.

 COASTAL PROTECTION 

WE URGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE NATIONAL  STRATEGY 
FOR COAST PROTECTION, TAKING ACCOUNT OF IDENTIFIED  PROBLEMS AND 
THE LIKELY EFFECTS OF FACTORS SUCH AS CLIMATE  CHANGE. THE 
RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR COAST PROTECTION  SHOULD BE TARGETED ON 
THE MOST URGENT COAST PROTECTION  PROBLEMS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
CRITERIA ESTABLISHED BY THE  NATIONAL STRATEGY.

6. PROTECTING OUR RURAL ENVIRONMENT (BACK TO
TOP)

FINE GAEL RECOGNISES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RURAL  ENVIRONMENT TO 
IRISH AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT.  FINE GAEL WANTS TO SEE 
FUTURE AGRICULTURE AND RURAL  DEVELOPMENT POLICIES TAKING FULL 
ACCOUNT OF THE NEED FOR  MEASURES TO BE ADOPTED TO PROMOTE 
GREATER ENVIRONMENTAL  SENSITIVITY AND SUSTAINABILITY, TO BE 
ACHIEVED THROUGH A  BALANCE OF EU SUPPORTED EXTENSIFICATION AND 
SUSTAINABLE  FARMING PRACTICES. THE RURAL ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION  SCHEME (REPS) HAS BEEN AN OUTSTANDING SUCCESS 
WITH  PARTICIPATION LEVELS RISING FROM JUST 350 IN DECEMBER 1994  
TO APPROXIMATELY 25,000 BY JUNE 1997. FINE GAEL CALLS FOR  
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE EU AIMED AT EXTENDING REPS FROM A 5  TO A 
15 YEAR SCHEME. 

AS FURTHER EVIDENCE OF THE IMPORTANCE WE ATTACH TO  
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY FARMING WE SEE THE INTRODUCTION  OF THE 
CAPITAL GRANTS SCHEME FOR THE CONTROL OF FARMYARD  POLLUTION, AS 
A PRIORITY IN THE EVENT OF SURPLUS FUNDING  BECOMING AVAILABLE 
FROM THE MID TERM REVIEW OF  STRUCTURAL FUNDS. 

7. PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (BACK
TO TOP)

 ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES 

WE BELIEVE THAT FEASIBILITY TARGETS SHOULD BE SET FOR THE  
PRODUCTION OF ELECTRICITY - UP TO 10% OF NATIONAL ELECTRICITY  
SUPPLY AND 10% OF NATIONAL FUEL USAGE - FROM RENEWABLES,  
ESPECIALLY WASTE MATERIALS. 

INCENTIVES SHOULD BE INTRODUCED TO ENCOURAGE THE PRIVATE  SECTOR 
TO ACHIEVE THESE TARGETS, EITHER BY PAYING REALISTIC  PRICES FOR THE 
SUPPLY OF ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLE  RESOURCES TO THE NATIONAL 
GRID OR THROUGH THE USE OF GRANT  AID. CONSIDERATION WILL BE GIVEN 
TO INCENTIVISING THE USE OF  WASTE RENEWABLES (E.G. ANIMAL OFFALS) 
AT A GREATER RATE THAN  NON-WASTE RENEWABLES. 

 ENERGY SELF-SUPPLY 

RELEVANT STATE BODIES (INCLUDING LOCAL AUTHORITIES) AND  PRIVATE 
COMPANIES SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO SELF-SUPPLY  APPROPRIATE 
FRACTIONS OF THEIR ENERGY NEEDS THROUGH JOINT  VENTURES WITH THE 
PRIVATE SECTOR. WE SEE CONSIDERABLE  SCOPE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION 
OF SMALL-SCALE COMBINED HEAT  AND POWER PLANTS IN THIS CONTEXT. 

 BIOMASS PRODUCTION 

INCENTIVES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR "SET ASIDE" LAND TO  PRODUCE 
RENEWABLE SOURCES OF BIOMASS FOR ELECTRICITY AND  BIOFUEL 
PRODUCTION. THE ELECTRICITY PRODUCED WOULD BE  SUPPLIED MAINLY 
TO THE NATIONAL GRID BUT WE WOULD HOPE  THAT IN TIME DECENTRALISED 
LOCAL OUTLETS WOULD BE FOUND FOR  THE ENERGY PRODUCED.

 ECO-FRIENDLY FUEL 

THE IRISH NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION SHOULD BE  ENCOURAGED 
TO PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN ACHIEVING TARGETS FOR  ATTAINING MINIMUM 
LEVELS OF NATIONAL ECO-FRIENDLY FUEL  USAGE AND SHOULD BE 
ENCOURAGED TO ENGAGE IN APPROPRIATE  JOINT VENTURES WITH THE 
PRIVATE SECTOR TO SECURE THESE  TARGETS. ACHIEVABLE TARGETS CAN BE 
SET TO INCREASE THE  PROPORTION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY FUEL 
(PREFERABLY  PRODUCED FROM RENEWABLES) IN NATIONAL FUEL 
CONSUMPTION -  SAY, 10% OF DIESEL AND PETROL CONSUMPTION. AN 
EXCISE-DUTY  EXEMPTION CURRENTLY APPLIES TO BIO-FUELS SO THE 
POLICY  CHALLENGE IS TO DEVELOP COST-EFFECTIVE SUPPLY STRATEGIES. 
 
ALL STATE BODIES/AGENCIES WHICH USE TRANSPORT FLEETS OF A  
SIGNIFICANT SIZE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO EMPLOY A GROWING  
PROPORTION OF VEHICLES USING ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY AND  
RENEWABLE-SOURCED FUELS.

REDUCING TRAFFIC CONGESTION

WE BELIEVE THAT TRAFFIC CONGESTION WILL EMERGE AS ONE OF  THE 
SINGLE BIGGEST CHALLENGES TO THE QUALITY OF OUR  ENVIRONMENT, AS 
PRIVATE CAR OWNERSHIP INCREASES  SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE YEARS AHEAD. 
FINE GAEL BELIEVES A  NUMBER OF KEY INITIATIVES ARE NEEDED TO 
LIMIT THE EXTENT OF  CONGESTION AND THE ATTENDANT PROBLEMS WITH 
JOURNEY  DELAYS, GREATER ACCIDENT FREQUENCIES, NOISE AND AIR  
POLLUTION. PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN CITIES MUST BE MADE A MORE  
ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO USING ONE'S CAR, ESPECIALLY FOR  
PREDICTABLE OR REGULAR JOURNEYS, SUCH AS COMMUTING TO AND  FROM 
WORK. WE WILL TAKE TWO IMPORTANT INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE 
THIS AIM. 

MEASUR 1
WE WILL PROMOTW THE INTRODUCTION OF 'FLEXI-TICKETS' FOR 
COMMUTERS WHICH ALLOW THE USE OF A SINGLE TICKET FOR ALL PUBLIC 
TRANSPORT FACILITIES (INCLUDING TAXIS DURING CERTAIN DESIGNATED 
TIMES) IN SPECIFIED COMMUTER ZONES. WE BELIEVE THIS WILL 
ENCOURAGE INCREASED USE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT.

MEASURE 2
FINE GAEL WILL ALSO CONSIDER ENCOURAGING THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
MULTI-STOREY CAR PARKS ON THE OUTER RIM OF CITIES. THIS MAY BE 
ACHIEVED BY TAX DESIGNATION. SUCH A DEVELOPMENT WOULD ALLOW 
COMMUTERS TO PARK THEIR CARS AND TRANSFER TO PUBLIC TRANSPORT 
SHUTTLE SERVICES FOR THEIR JOURNEY INTO THE CITY CENTRE. THERE IS 
CONSIDERABLE SCOPE FOR SUCH INVESTMENT IN ALL OF OUR MAJOR CITIES. 
CONSIDERATION WILL ALSO BE GIVEN TO EXTENDING THE FLEXI-TICKET 
SYSTEM TO INCLUDE BOTH PARKING AND TRANSPORT CHARGES.

TO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF BICYCLE TRANSPORT, WE WILL PROVIDE 
SUITABLE SECURE CYCLE PARKS IN THE CITY CENTRE.

ESTABLISH OPERATION FREEFLOW ON A PERMANENT BASIS

WE PROPOSE TO MAKE OPERATION FREEFLOW A PERMANET FEATURE AND 
TO EXTEND ITS SCOPE TO OTHER CITIES AND LARGE TOWNS. ENFORCEMENT 
OF THE BASIC TRAFFIC REGULATIONS AN THE VISIBLE PRESCENCE OF GARDAI 
IN A TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT ROLE WORK EFFECTIVELY TO RELIEVE 
CONGESTION AS OPERATION FREEFLOW BEFORE CHRISTMAS LAST AMPLY 
DEMONSTRATED

INTEGRATE THE DART AND LUAS

WE ARE COMMITTED TO EXTENDING THE LUAS SERVICE TO BALLYMUN, 
THE AIRPORT AND THE SANDYFORD INDUSTRIAL ESTATE AND INTEGRATING 
THE DART AND LUAS SYSTEMS. THE LUAS SYSTEM WILL BE THE SINGLE 
MOST IMPORTANT PUBLIC TRANSPORT INVESTMENT THIS CENTURY. IT HAS 
THE POTENTIAL, AS PART OF AN INTEGRATED TRAFFIC PLAN FOR DUBLIN, TO 
REDUCE CONGESTION SUBSTANTIALLY. WE SEE THIS INTEGRATION INITIATIVE 
AS A WORTHY MILLENIUM PROJECT FOR OUR CAPITAL CITY AND ONE WHICH 
WILL BE HIGHLY COST EFFECTIVE.

  LIVING AND WORKING 

FINE GAEL BELIEVES THAT WE NEED NEW PROCESSES AND NEW  
INITIATIVES IN THE PLANNING OF OUR PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT.

OUR EXISTING SYSTEMS OF DEVELOPMENT PLANS, PLANNING  
PERMISSIONS AND APPEALS ARE NOT ADEQUATE FOR THE NEW  
MILLENNIUM. PEOPLE DO NOT FEEL THEY HAVE A SAY OR THAT THEY  CAN 
CONTRIBUTE TO A PROCESS THAT DETERMINES, IN LARGE  MEASURE THE 
QUALITY OF THEIR DAILY LIVES. THIS IS PARTICULARLY  ACUTE IN LARGER 
URBAN AREAS.

WE DO NOT SEE PLANNING AS PURELY AN ISSUE OF ZONING. IT  INVOLVES 
WHERE WE LIVE, THE SCHOOLS OUR CHILDREN WILL  ATTEND, THE 
RECREATIONAL AREAS THEY WILL USE, THE GARDA' WHO WILL SECURE OUR 
STREETS, THE PLACES WE WORK AND THE ROADS,  TRANSPORT AND OTHER 
SERVICES WE NEED TO LIVE AND WORK.  PLANNING INVOLVES ALL OF 
THESE AS WELL AS THE PROTECTION OF  THE ENVIRONMENT AND OUR 
NATURAL RESOURCES.

 A NEW PROCESS 

FINE GAEL BELIEVES THAT LOCAL AND REGIONAL FORA FOR THE  
PREPARATION OF INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT PLANS SHOULD BE  
ESTABLISHED. THESE WILL INVOLVE LOCAL AUTHORITIES,  COMMUNITY AND 
RESIDENTS GROUPS, GARDA', CHAMBERS OF  COMMERCE, INDUSTRIAL 
DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES, FARMING  ORGANISATIONS, OTHER GROUPS 
AND THE APPROPRIATE  GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.  
PLANNING OUR PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT IS NOT A STATIC EXERCISE.  IT IS A 
VIBRANT CHANGING PROCESS WHICH MUST INVOLVE ALL  INTERESTED 
PARTIES IF IT IS TO WORK. WE WILL SUPPORT THE  FOLLOWING INITIATIVES:

 A GREATER ROLE FOR RESIDENTS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR ESTATES 
AND ESPECIALLY THE USE OF PUBLIC AREAS. 

 THE INTRODUCTION OF A SYSTEM OF PRE-DESIGNATING SITES FOR 
SPECIFIED INDUSTRIAL USE. THIS WILL BE DONE IN CONSULTATION WITH 
LOCAL GROUPS AS PART OF THE PLANNING FORA SET OUT ABOVE. THE TYPES 
OF INDUSTRY AND THE FRAMEWORK FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 
WOULD BE AGREED IN ADVANCE. ANY NEW INDUSTRY MEETING THESE 
CRITERIA WOULD GET FORMAL PERMISSION WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD. THIS 
WE BELIEVE WOULD LEAD TO MORE EFFICIENT AND ENVIRONMENTALLY 
FRIENDLY PLANNING. 

 THE INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION TO ENSURE THAT COMMERCIAL 
DEVELOPMENTS SUCH AS SHOPPING CENTRES WILL HAVE TO INSTALL 
CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION SYSTEMS WHICH WILL BE ACCESSIBLE TO THE 
GARDA'.
