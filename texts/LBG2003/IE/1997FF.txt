OF FIANNA FAIL, BERTIE AHERN - TD

THE CHOICE BEFORE IRELAND
   
IS CŒIS MH-R BR-ID DOMSA MAR CHEANNAIRE FHIANNA F‡IL AN CH‡IPŽIS SEO A SHEOLADH

NA HIDŽIL SIN, AGUS BA MH-R LINN IAD A CHUR I GCR'CH.
    
EVERY ELECTION IS IMPORTANT TO THE PEOPLE, BUT THIS ELECTION IS IMPORTANT AS 
NEVER BEFORE. 

FOR RARELY HAS IRELAND FACED SUCH A CRITICAL RANGE OF OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS. 
IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, WE HAVE THE CHOICE OF REALISING THOSE OPPORTUNITIES OR 
SUCCUMBING TO THOSE THREATS.  THE CHOICE BEFORE THE PEOPLE IS AS STARK AS THAT. 

ECONOMICALLY, WE NOW HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON THE CURRENT WAVE OF 
SUCCESS, LAYING SOLID FOUNDATIONS FOR A PROSPEROUS IRELAND IN THE 21ST CENTURY 
AS A VIABLE MEMBER OF EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION AND AN EFFECTIVE PLAYER IN AN 
ENLARGED EUROPE. OR WE CAN SQUANDER THE BENEFITS OF OUR PRESENT POSITION, 
CONDEMNING THE FUTURE IRELAND TO BE AN ALSO-RAN  ALWAYS IN NEED OF SUPPORT IN A 
WORLD MUCH LESS READY TO GIVE IT. 

FIVE YEARS ON, WE WILL NO LONGER HAVE THIS CHOICE. SOCIALLY, WE NOW HAVE THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO ACT DECISIVELY ON THE CANCER OF CRIME  BY ENFORCING OUR LAWS 
EFFECTIVELY AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY, BY REMOVING FOR EVER THE DISADVANTAGE IN 
OUR SOCIETY THAT GIVES RISE TO MUCH OF IT. 

OR WE CAN WATCH HELPLESSLY WHILE LAWLESSNESS TAKES OVER OUR COUNTRY, AND THE GAP 
GROWS WIDER BETWEEN THE HAVES AND HAVE-NOTS.  FIVE YEARS ON, WE WILL NO LONGER 
HAVE THIS CHOICE.

TECHNOLOGICALLY, WE NOW HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CATAPULT IRELAND TO THE FRONT 
RANK OF THE INFORMATION AGE, WHERE WE CAN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY USE OUR 
STRENGTHS TO FULL ADVANTAGE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE OUR HISTORICAL WEAKNESSES 
NEED NO LONGER MATTER. 

OR WE CAN BE JUST ONLOOKERS IN THIS LATEST REVOLUTION, DOING TOO LITTLE TOO LATE  
AND CONDEMNING OURSELVES AND OUR CHILDREN TO SECOND-DIVISION STATUS IN THE NEW 
MILLENNIUM. 

FIVE YEARS ON, WE WILL NO LONGER HAVE THAT CHOICE. 


POLITICALLY, WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESTORE THE PEOPLEIS CONFIDENCE IN THE 
PROCESS OF GOVERNMENT  INVOLVING THEM IN IT AS NEVER BEFORE, MAKING THE 
ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT GENUINELY RESPONSIVE TO THEIR NEEDS, AND FRANKLY 
ADDRESSING THE DEMAND TO ERADICATE ALL UNETHICAL CONDUCT FROM PUBLIC LIFE.

OR WE CAN GO ON AS BEFORE, FIDDLING WITH DETAILS WHILE IGNORING THE REAL 
PROBLEMS THAT ARE CAUSING PEOPLE TO LOSE CONFIDENCE IN OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.

FIVE YEARS ON, WE WILL NO LONGER HAVE THAT CHOICE. 

IN REGARD TO THE NORTHERN IRELAND PROBLEM, WE NOW HAVE A NEW OPPORTUNITY TO 
BUILD ON THE HOPE CREATED BY THE PEACE PROCESS  REDOUBLING OUR ENERGIES IN THE 
FACE OF THE OBSTACLES THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN ITS PATH. OR WE CAN RETREAT TO THE 
STERILE ATTITUDES OF THE PAST 30 YEARS, AND CONDEMN THE WHOLE OF THIS ISLAND TO 
A FUTURE THAT STUNTS ITS POTENTIAL AND PERPETUATES VIOLENCE AND INJUSTICE. 

FIVE YEARS ON, WE WILL NO LONGER HAVE THAT CHOICE.
    
THE CHOICE NOW BEFORE THE PEOPLE IS TO DECIDE WHICH GOVERNMENT IS MORE LIKELY TO 
BUILD ON THESE OPPORTUNITIES, AND WHICH GOVERNMENT IS MORE LIKELY TO SUCCUMB TO 
THESE THREATS.

SINCE BECOMING LEADER OF FIANNA F‡IL TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO, I HAVE TRAVELLED 
UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY LISTENING TO PEOPLE. WHAT STRUCK ME MOST FORCIBLY WAS 
HOW OUT OF TOUCH THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT ARE WITH THE PEOPLEIS REAL CONCERNS. 
THEY KEPT THEIR HEADS DOWN, RELENTLESSLY PURSUING POLICIES THAT THEY THOUGHT 
WOULD IMPRESS THE ELECTORATE RATHER THAN IMPLEMENTING POLICIES THE COUNTRY 
NEEDED.

THE PEOPLE COULD CLEARLY SEE THAT THE ECONOMIC BOOM WAS NOT BEING USED TO CURE 
OUR ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, BUT FOR SHORT-TERM GAINS THAT WOULD COST US DEAR LATER 
ON.

THE PEOPLE COULD CLEARLY SEE THAT CRIME WAS GETTING OUT OF HAND, SPURRED ON BY 
THE RAPIDLY WORSENING POSITION ON DRUGS. 

THE PEOPLE COULD CLEARLY SEE THAT THE PLIGHT OF THE DISADVANTAGED WAS 
BEGINING TO TEAR APART THE FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY. 

THE PEOPLE COULD CLEARLY SEE THAT THE WORLD WAS GOING THROUGH ANOTHER INDUSTRIAL 
REVOLUTION, BRINGING IN THE INFORMATION AGE, AND THAT WE WERE NOT PREPARING 
PROPERLY FOR IT. 



THE PEOPLE COULD CLEARLY SEE THAT THE POLITICAL  PROCESS WAS NOT FOCUSED ON 
THEIR NEEDS.

THE PEOPLE COULD CLEARLY SEE THAT A PRICELESS OPPORTUNITY FOR PEACE IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND WAS BEING LET SLIP THROUGH OUR FINGERS.


MEANWHILE, THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT COULD SEE NONE OF THESE THINGS. THE RESULT WAS 
A LARGELY WASTED TWO AND A HALF YEARS. TIME AND AGAIN, THE GOVERNMENT TOOK VITAL 
ACTION ONLY WHEN PRODDED TO BY FIANNA F‡IL, AND WHEN WE GAVE THEM THE IDEAS AND 
DRAFT LEGISLATION TO DO IT.

THIS MANIFESTO IS FIANNA F‡ILIS RESPONSE TO THE NEEDS OF THE IRISH PEOPLE TODAY. 
IN A REAL SENSE, IT IS THE PEOPLEIS MANIFESTO. IT IS A RECIPE FOR GRASPING THE 
OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE BEFORE 

IRELAND NOW HAS A ONCE-OFF CHANCE FOR US TO AFFECT OUR DESTINY DECISIVELY FOR 
THE 21ST CENTURY. IT IS A PROGRAMME THAT PEOPLE KNOW FIANNA FAIL CAN DELIVER. 
AND WITH THE PEOPLEIS SUPPORT, WE WILL DELIVER IT.
    
    





    
    
BERTIE AHERN

     
     












PRUDENTLY MANAGING THE ECONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWTH 

FIANNA FAIL IN GOVERNMENT WILL 

MAKE PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF OUR NATIONAL FINANCES THE OVERRIDNG POLICY OBJECTIVE 
OF GOVERNMENT, AS THE BEST WAY TO SUSTAIN A BETTER LIFE FOR ALL IN THE 
CHALLENGING TIMES AHEAD.

PUT A CEILING ON THE ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF THE NATIONAL DEBT, AND THEN START 
PROGRESSIVELY REDUCING IT. 

RUN A CURRENT SURPLUS EACH YEAR  AND IN FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES 
ELIMINATE THE EXCHEQUER BORROWING REQUIREMENT ALTOGETHER. 

KEEP STRICTLY TO THE TARGETS WE SET FOR PUBLIC SPENDING, WHICH WILL STEADILY 
DECLINE AS A PROPORTION OF NATIONAL OUTPUT.

PAY FOR LOWER TAXES AND BETTER PUBLIC SERVICES OUT OF THE DIVIDEND FROM THIS 
PRUDENT, FORWARD-LOOKING ECONOMIC STRATEGY.
 


CHALLENGES WE MUST PREPARE FOR 

FIANNA FAIL BELIEVE IT IS VITAL THAT IRELAND IS ABLE TO JOIN THE FIRST PHASE OF 
ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION. EMU HAS POTENTIALLY GREAT BENEFITS FOR THE NATION, 
ESPECIALLY IN LOWER INTEREST RATES AND BUSINESS COSTS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT 
BRINGS WITH IT MAJOR CHALLENGES.

MAINTAINING AND IMPROVING OUR COMPETITIVENESS, ESPECIALLY IF BRITAIN STAYS OUT 
OF EMU, IS CRITICAL. ALSO VITAL IS THE NEED FOR FINANCIAL SPARE CAPACITY  SO WE 
CAN RESPOND TO ANY SHORT-TERM CRISES WITHOUT INFRINGING THE STRICT CONDITIONS OF 
THE EUROPEAN STABILITY PACT. 

TO PROTECT OUR PRESENT GROWTH WITHIN THE MUCH MORE DEMANDING RŽGIME OF EMU, WE 
MUST STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF OUR ECONOMY NOW. 


THIS IS NO TIME TO LOWER OUR GUARD, AS HAS BEEN HAPPENING SYSTEMATICALLY UNDER 
THE LOOSE-SPENDING RAINBOW GOVERNMENT.

WE NEED ECONOMIC STRENGTH ALSO TO RESPOND PRO-ACTIVELY TO 
THE OPPORTUNITIES OF A WORLD MARKETPLACE THAT IS CHANGING FAST. 

IRELAND MUST POSITION ITSELF AGGRESSIVELY IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE INFORMATION 
AGE. WE MUST CARVE OUT MARKET POSITIONS FOR THIS COUNTRY IN THE EASTERN MARKETS 
WHICH WILL BE THE ECONOMIC PIVOT OF THE 21ST CENTURY.
  

DANGER SIGNALS FROM THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT 

DESPITE THE PRESENT HIGH GROWTH, IRELANDIS COMPETITIVENESS AND THE FUTURE 
STRENGTH OF OUR ECONOMY IS SERIOUSLY  THREATENED BY:

A NATIONAL DEBT THAT HAS NOW PASSED £30 BILLION, AND IF PRESENT POLICIES ARE NOT 
CHANGED WILL BE OVER £32 BILLION BY 1999. THE £2.5 BILLION ANNUAL COST OF 
SERVICING THIS DEBT (OVER HALF THE ENTIRE TAKE FROM INCOME TAX) IS THE MAIN 
BARRIER TO LOWER TAXES AND BETTER PUBLIC SERVICES.

PUBLIC SPENDING THAT HAS BEEN LET GET OUT OF CONTROL. UNDER THE RAINBOW 
GOVERNMENT, SPENDING HAS LEAPT BY OVER A FIFTH  MORE THAN THREE TIMES THE RATE 
OF INFLATION. THIS GOVERNMENT HAVE RECKLESSLY FAILED TO MEET EVEN THEIR OWN 
UNDEMANDING TARGETS FOR CONTAINING SPENDING, OVERSHOOTING BY £600 MILLION OF 
TAXPAYERSI MONEY.

UNEMPLOYMENT THAT STILL RUNS AT A QUARTER OF A MILLION WAY ABOVE THE EU AVERAGE.

HIGHER PERSONAL TAX THAN IN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE ON LOW 
AND MEDIUM INCOMES. UNCOMPETITIVE TAX RATES THROTTLE JOB CREATION AND REDUCE 
IRELANDIS ATTRACTION AS A LOCATION FOR INWARD INVESTMENT.

ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT THAT HAS BEEN INHIBITED BY THE INCONSISTENT ATTITUDE OF A 
GOVERNMENT WHICH LACKS A STRONG PRO-ENTERPRISE ATTITUDE.

PUBLIC SERVICES THAT IN MANY CASES STILL NEED MODERNISATION AND INVESTMENT, AND 
WHICH ARE REELING FROM THE SHORT-SIGHTED, PROCRASTINATING AND DESTRUCTIVE 
APPROACH TO THE STATE SECTOR TAKEN BY THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT.


FIANNA FAIL'S TRACK RECORD IN PRUDENT MANAGEMENT 

FIANNA FAIL'S ABILITY TO MANAGE THE NATIONAL FINANCES 
PRUDENTLY IS WELL PROVEN. 

OVER THE PAST DECADE OUR CONSISTENT POLICY HAS BEEN TO LAY FIRM FOUNDATIONS FOR 
FUTURE GROWTH, AND AT THE SAME TIME IMPROVE VITAL SERVICES AND BRING DOWN TAXES 
BY CONTROLLING COSTS AND INCREASING EFFICIENCY. 

IN 1987 WE CREATED THE GROUND-BREAKING SOCIAL PARTNERSHIP WHICH BECAME THE 
FRAMEWORK FOR CAREFULLY-MANAGED GROWTH. BETWEEN 1987 AND 1990, WE CUT GOVERNMENT 
SPENDING FROM 53% OF NATIONAL OUTPUT TO 38%.  WE SET DEMANDING COST LIMITS, AND 
PERFORMED EVEN BETTER THAN WE PROMISED. WE NEGOTIATED UNPRECEDENTED INCREASES IN 
EU FUNDING IN 1989 AND 1993, AND  EVEN MORE IMPORTANT  PUT THOSE FUNDS TO 
PRODUCTIVE WORK THROUGH FAR-SIGHTED INVESTMENT.

FIANNA FAIL'S STRATEGY PROTECTED OUR ECONOMY DURING THE WORLD RECESSION THAT 
BEGAN IN 1990, MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO MEET THE MAASTRICHT GUIDELINES, AND 
SET THE SCENE FOR THE PRESENT REMARKABLE GROWTH WHICH THE RAINBOW COALITION 
INHERITED AND HAS BEEN LARGELY SQUANDERING FOR SHORT-TERM GAIN.

THE PAY-OFF FROM FIANNA FAIL'S PRUDENCE WAS OUR ABILITY TO REDUCE THE TAX BURDEN 
OUT OF THE BENEFITS THE STRATEGY PRODUCED. 

DURING OUR LAST PERIOD IN GOVERNMENT, FIANNA F‡IL CUT

THE STANDARD RATE OF INCOME TAX FROM 35% TO 27%

THE TOP RATE FROM 58% TO 48%  
   
THE STANDARD RATE OF VAT FROM 25% TO 21%

CORPORATION TAX FROM 43% TO 40%.

THESE, ALONG WITH A WIDE RANGE OF OTHER RELIEFS, REDUCED THE TAX BURDEN BY JUST 
UNDER ONE BILLION POUNDS (£960 MILLION). IN 1994 ALONE, BERTIE AHERN AS MINISTER 
FOR FINANCE LOWERED TAXES BY £333 MILLION, 60% MORE THAN RUAIRI QUINN COULD 
MANAGE THE FOLLOWING YEAR. DESPITE THIS YEARIS ELECTION BUDGET, THE RAINBOW 
GOVERNMENTIS POLICY HAS CLEARLY BEEN TO RAISE SPENDING RATHER THAN TO LOWER 
TAXES, WHILE WORSENING THE OVERALL STATE OF THE NATIONAL FINANCES. 

FIANNA FAIL'S PROVEN POLICY, IN CONTRAST, IS TO CONTAIN SPENDING AND TO FUND 
GROWTH-STIMULATING TAX CUTS OUT OF WHAT CAN BE PRUDENTLY AFFORDED.

THE NATIONAL DEBT - A BURDEN TOO FAR

THE NATIONAL DEBT NOW STANDS AT OVER £30 BILLION. ONLY 25 YEARS AGO, IT WAS A 
LITTLE OVER £1 BILLION.  NOWADAYS WE SPEND MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT EACH YEAR JUST 
TO SERVICE THE DEBT.

SINCE THE FIANNA FAIL BUDGETS OF 1987-9, THE NATIONAL DEBT HAS DECLINED STEEPLY 
RELATIVE TO NATIONAL OUTPUT  FROM 125% OF GNP IN 1987 TO 90% NOW. BUT IN 
ABSOLUTE TERMS THE TOTAL DEBT CONTINUES TO CLIMB, WITH BETWEEN £500M AND £1 
BILLION ADDED NEARLY EVERY YEAR. SOME 15% OF ALL CURRENT SPENDING, EQUIVALENT TO 
56% OF INCOME TAX REVENUE IN 1996, STILL GOES SIMPLY ON SERVICING THE NATIONAL 
DEBT.

FIANNA F‡IL, IN THE INTERESTS OF THE NATIONIS FUTURE ECONOMIC STABILITY AND 
PROSPERITY, WILL SET A CEILING ON THE NATIONAL DEBT. 

FIANNA F‡IL MAKE A FURTHER COMMITMENT: ONCE WE HAVE ELIMINATED FURTHER 
BORROWING, WE WILL ADOPT A DELIBERATE POLICY OF PAYING OFF THE NATIONAL DEBT. 
EACH YEAR WE WILL ASSESS AND REPORT PUBLICLY ON THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DOING 
THIS. ANY BUDGET SURPLUS WILL BE USED MAINLY TO REDUCE THE NATIONAL DEBT. SOME 
OF THE REDUCTIONS IN CURRENT SPENDING RESULTING FROM A FALLING NATIONAL DEBT 
WILL BE USED TO LOWER THE TAX BURDEN.

TIME TO BALANCE THE BUDGET 

BERTIE AHERN AS MINISTER FOR FINANCE IN 1994 PRODUCED THE FIRST CURRENT BUDGET 
SURPLUS FOR MORE THAN A QUARTER CENTURY.  UNDER THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT THIS SLID 
BACK INTO DEFICIT IN 1995, BEFORE RETURNING TO SURPLUS IN 1996. 

FIANNA F‡IL WILL ENSURE THAT, BARRING SERIOUS RECESSION, THERE WILL BE NO 
FURTHER CURRENT BUDGET DEFICIT. INDEED, IN ORDER TO FINANCE ANY NECESSARY 
CAPITAL BORROWING WHILE STILL MEETING THE MAASTRICHT TARGETS, OUR AIM IS TO RUN 
A SUBSTANTIAL AND INCREASING CURRENT BUDGET SURPLUS IN THE YEARS AHEAD.

FIANNA F‡IL WILL FURTHER SEEK TO ELIMINATE THE EXCHEQUER BORROWING REQUIREMENT 
(EBR) ALTOGETHER, AS RECOMMENDED BY THE ESRI. 

THE EBR HAS BEEN TARGETED AT BETWEEN £600M AND £750M FOR SEVERAL YEARS, BUT THE 
1996 OUTTURN OF £437M AND REVENUE BUOYANCY THIS YEAR SHOWS THAT IT COULD BE 
ELIMINATED WITHOUT UNDUE STRAIN.



BRINGING COSTS BACK UNDER CONTROL  

GROWTH IN PUBLIC SPENDING MUST TO BE KEPT ON A TIGHT REIN, IF THE ECONOMY IS TO 
CONTINUE GROWING, INFLATION TO STAY UNDER CONTROL, AND IF WE ARE TO SHARPEN 
FURTHER OUR COMPETITIVENESS.

FIANNA F‡IL WILL KEEP PUBLIC SPENDING BELOW 40% OF GNP AND ON A STEADILY 
DECLINING TREND, ASSUMING NORMAL GROWTH CONDITIONS.

WE WILL LIMIT THE ANNUAL GROWTH IN NET CURRENT SPENDING (POST-BUDGET), INCLUDING 
DEBT SERVICING, TO 4%, UNTIL EXCHEQUER BORROWING IS ELIMINATED. ASSUMING 
INFLATION OF AROUND 2%, THIS LIMIT COULD STILL ALLOW A REAL ANNUAL RISE IN 
SPENDING ON SERVICES OF AROUND 2%. 

WE WILL LIMIT GROWTH IN EXCHEQUER CAPITAL SPENDING TO 5% A YEAR, UNTIL THE 
CURRENT BUDGET SURPLUS IS EQUAL TO AND CAN OFFSET EXCHEQUER BORROWING FOR 
CAPITAL PURPOSES.

WE WILL DELIVER BETTER VALUE FOR MONEY IN 
PUBLIC SPENDING, WHILE RESPONDING TO THE JUSTIFIED PUBLIC DEMAND FOR AN IMPROVED 
QUALITY OF  SERVICES  ESPECIALLY IN HEALTH, EDUCATION, 
WELFARE, LAW AND ORDER, AND ROADS.

FIANNA F‡IL ARE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO SOCIAL PARTNERSHIP IN A HANDS-ON WAY, AND 
WILL FULFIL THE TERMS OF PROGRAMME 2000.


A FAIRER DEAL ON TAX 

FIANNA F‡IL AIM TO RECREATE THE LOW-TAX ECONOMY THAT WE HAD UNTIL THE LATE 
1960S, WHILE MAINTAINING AND IMPROVING NECESSARY PUBLIC SERVICES. CREATING SUCH 
AN ECONOMY IS THE BEST WAY OF STIMULATING NEW JOBS AND SUSTAINING EXISTING ONES.

OUR GOAL IS NOT JUST TO REFORM THE TAX SYSTEM FOR ITS OWN SAKE, BUT TO USE TAX 
REFORM TO REDUCE THE TAX BURDEN. WE BELIEVE IRISH PEOPLE AT ALL LEVELS OF INCOME 
MUST BE ABLE TO TAKE HOME AS MUCH OF THEIR PAY AS PEOPLE DO IN OTHER 
NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES.

FIANNA F‡IL WILL HONOUR FULLY ALL THE TAX COMMITMENTS IN PROGRAMME 2000. WHERE 
POSSIBLE, WE WILL DO BETTER DURING THE LIFETIME OF THE PROGRAMME AND BEYOND.






FIANNA F‡ILIS EIGHT KEY PRIORITIES FOR REDUCING THE TAX BURDEN OVER THE NEXT 
FIVE YEARS, AS RESOURCES BECOME AVAILABLE, ARE:

A NEW, INTRODUCTORY TAX RATE OF 20%.WE INTEND THIS MAINLY TO REDRESS THE HIGH 
PROPORTION OF WAGES TAKEN IN TAX FROM YOUNG PEOPLE ENTERING THE WORKFORCE.  WE 
WILL PROGRESSIVELY EXTEND THE SCOPE OF THIS RATE SO THAT IT WILL BECOME THE 
STANDARD RATE.

BROADER TAX BANDS, WITH THE TARGET THAT 80% OF TOTAL INCOME IS TAXED AT THE 
STANDARD RATE.

A LOWER CEILING ON THE COMBINED MARGINAL RATE FOR ALL DEDUCTIONS (INCOME TAX, 
LEVIES, AND PRSI) OF NO MORE THAN 50%. (AT PRESENT, THE TOP COMBINED RATE IS 
56%.) OUR FURTHER OBJECTIVE IS TO LOWER THE COMBINED MARGINAL RATE BELOW 50%, 
OVER TIME. 

AS PART OF THIS STRATEGY, OUR TARGET WILL BE TO GET THE TOP RATE OF TAX DOWN 
FROM 48% TO 43%.

TAX RELIEF AT THE STANDARD RATE OF UP TO £2,000 INITIALLY, FOR VOUCHED SPENDING 
ON REGISTERED CHILD-MINDERS (INCLUDING CRÈCHES AND PRE-SCHOOLS), AND ON CARING 
FOR THE AGED OR HANDICAPPED.

TAX RELIEF AT THE STANDARD RATE ON UP TO £2,000 INITIALLY, AS RECOGNITION FOR 
MARRIED PEOPLE WHO STAY AT HOME TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN (AND WHO DO NOT GET 
ANY STATE BENEFIT OTHER THAN CHILD BENEFIT). THIS WILL BE PAYABLE AS A 
REFUND, DIRECTLY TO THE PERSON AT HOME.

HIGHER TAX-FREE ALLOWANCES FOR OLD-AGE PENSIONERS BEGINNING WITH THOSE OVER 75 
AND IN TIME EXTENDING TO ALL OVER 70.

PEOPLE LIVING IN THE REPUBLIC BUT WORKING IN NORTHERN IRELAND, OFTEN AT LOWER 
RATES OF PAY, WILL PAY NO MORE TAX ON THAT INCOME THAN THEY WOULD IF THEY WERE 
LIVING IN THE NORTH.

WE ARE CONFIDENT PROGRESS TOWARDS THESE OBJECTIVES CAN BE ACHIEVED BY STEADY AND 
CONSISTENT ACTION OVER SEVERAL BUDGETS.

GETTING OUR PRIORITIES RIGHT 

BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT A SOUND ECONOMY IS THE ESSENTIAL FOUNDATION FOR 
EVERYTHING WE WISH TO DO, ALL POLICIES AND COMMITMENTS IN THIS FIANNA F‡IL 
MANIFESTO ARE SUBJECT TO MEETING THE BORROWING AND PUBLIC SPENDING TARGETS SET 
OUT HERE, AND THE ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT  TO STAY WITHIN THE MAASTRICHT CRITERIA 
AT ALL TIMES.
   
WINNING THE COUNTRY

WINNING THE WAR AGAINST CRIME 

FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL

GIVE PRIORITY TO A BROADLY-BASED WAR AGAINST CRIME

DEVELOP A LONG-TERM NATIONAL STRATEGY ON CRIME THROUGH A WHITE PAPER PROCESS

ADOPT A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY ON ALL CRIME

STRENGTHEN THE GARDA' WITH THE RIGHT RESOURCES AND STRUCTURES, INCREASING THE 
FORCE BY 1,200 TO ITS FULL COMPLEMENT

SPEED UP THE COURTS SYSTEM

EXPAND THE NUMBER OF PRISON PLACES BY 2,000 


A DRAMATICALLY WORSENING CRIME SITUATION 

IN THE LIFETIME OF THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT, A MERE TWO AND A HALF YEARS, CRIME IN 
IRELAND HAS BECOME DRAMATICALLY WORSE. 

SO-CALLED ÒPETTY CRIMEÓ HAS MUSHROOMED, MUCH OF IT UNREPORTED AND MOST OF IT 
UNDETECTED AND UNPUNISHED. ALONGSIDE THIS WE HAVE SEEN AN ALARMING GROWTH IN 
SERIOUS VIOLENT CRIME, MOST OF IT DRUGS-RELATED. ORGANISED CRIME, ONCE SOMETHING 
WE KNEW ONLY THROUGH FICTION AND FILM , HAS SUDDENLY EMERGED AS A VICIOUS 
REALITY IN IRISH SOCIETY. CRIME THREATENS US ON OUR STREETS, IN OUR HOMES, AND 
IN OUR BUSINESSES.

FIANNA F‡IL SAW THIS COMING. THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT DID NOT. THOUGH WE WERE IN 
OPPOSITION, FIANNA F‡IL PUT FORWARD MEASURES TO DEAL WITH THE THREAT: WE 
PROPOSED 13 CRIMINAL JUSTICE BILLS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 1995. NO FEWER THAN 
THREE OF THESE BILLS ARE NOW THE LAW OF THE LAND, HASTILY ADOPTED BY THE RAINBOW 
GOVERNMENT WHEN IT EVENTUALLY SAW SENSE. BECAUSE OF US,  THE BAIL LAWS ARE NOW 
REFORMED. BECAUSE OF US,  THE STATE CAN NOW PURSUE THE ILLICIT ASSETS OF 
CRIMINALS.
FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE THE PRESENT CRIME THREAT IS NOT JUST A WORSENING OF 
SOMETHING THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN WITH US. THE THREAT WE FACE NOW IS DIFFERENT IN 
KIND: IT POSES A MAJOR THREAT TO THE FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY.

THE NEXT GOVERNMENT HAS A BRIEF OPPORTUNITY TO WIN CONTROL OF THE SITUATION, 
BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. WE STILL HAVE IT WITHIN OUR POWER TO ARREST THE GROWTH OF 
CRIME, AND ROLL IT BACK. UNLESS WE ACT EFFECTIVELY NOW, WE WILL HAVE A VERY 
DIFFERENT AND UNPLEASANT IRELAND IN FIVE YEARSI TIME  AND IT WILL BE FIVE YEARS 
TOO LATE, BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE LOST THE OPPORTUNITY WHICH MUST BE GRASPED NOW.

FIANNA F‡IL WILL MAKE A BROADLY-BASED WAR ON CRIME A CENTRAL PRIORITY OF OUR 
FIRST YEARS IN GOVERNMENT. OUR STRATEGY IS TO FIGHT EACH AND EVERY CRIME THROUGH 
EFFECTIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ATTACKING THE ROOT CAUSES OF 
CRIME THAT ARISE THROUGH SOCIAL DEPRIVATION.

FROM PANIC MEASURES TO A PROPER STRATEGY

THE IMPACT OF FIANNA F‡ILIS PRESENCE IN GOVERNMENT WILL BE FELT AT ONCE. 
HOWEVER, ONE OF THE BIGGEST NEEDS IS TO REPLACE THE PRESENT GOVERNMENTIS AD HOC 
APPROACH TO THE CRISIS WITH A CAREFULLY THOUGHT-OUT STRATEGY THAT HAS THE 
SUPPORT OF EVERYBODY. IN OUR FIRST YEAR IN GOVERNMENT, FIANNA F‡IL WILL DEVELOP 
A WHITE PAPER ON CRIME. ALL RELEVANT OFFICIAL AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE GARDA' AND 
THE PRISON AND PROBATION SERVICES AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE LEGAL 
PROFESSION, THE JUDICIARY AND VICTIM SUPPORT, WILL BE CONSULTED. WE WILL ALSO 
INVOLVE COMMUNITY AND LOCAL DRUGS AWARENESS GROUPS IN THIS CONSULTATIVE PROCESS, 
INVITING SUBMISSIONS ON THE NATURE OF CRIME IN IRELAND TODAY AND ON HOW IT COULD 
BE MANAGED.  

WE WILL DRAW ON THESE SUBMISSIONS TO PUBLISH A COMPREHENSIVE WHITE PAPER SETTING 
OUT GOVERNMENT DECISIONS ON LONG-TERM STRATEGY.

ZERO TOLERANCE - NO CRIME, AND NO VICTIM OF CRIME, IS 
UNIMPORTANT 

GIVEN THE THREAT THE NATION FACES, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE GOVERNMENTIS 
ATTITUDE TO CRIME IS CLEAR-CUT.  IN FIANNA F‡ILIS VIEW, THERE ARE NO 
INSIGNIFICANT CRIMES TODAY. AND, MOST CERTAINLY, THERE ARE NO UNIMPORTANT 
VICTIMS  WHICH IS WHY WE WILL FULLY IMPLEMENT THE CHARTER FOR THE VICTIMS OF 
CRIME WHICH WE PUBLISHED IN 1996.

FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL OPERATE A  STRATEGY OF ZERO TOLERANCE, AN 
APPROACH THAT HAS PRODUCED IMPRESSIVE RESULTS ELSEWHERE. 



THIS REFLECTS THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES:

NO CRIME, NO MATTER HOW SMALL, IS INSIGNIFICANT;

THERE IS A DEFINITE CONNECTION BETWEEN LESSER AND MORE
SERIOUS CRIMES;

TOLERANCE OF SMALL CRIMES CREATES A CLIMATE WHERE BIG CRIMES FLOURISH;

CERTAIN CRIMES WILL NOT BE OVERLOOKED BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT IMPORTANT,

TOLERATION OF LESSER CRIMES SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE TO THE LAW-ABIDING 
CITIZEN THAT THE GARDA' AND THE GOVERNMENT ARE INEFFECTIVE.

ACCORDINGLY, WE WILL OVERLOOK NO CRIMES BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT PERCEIVED TO BE 
IMPORTANT.  ZERO TOLERANCE MEANS IMPLEMENTING THE LAW OF THE LAND AS IT STANDS.

BACKING THE GARDA' WITH THE RIGHT RESOURCES AND STRUCTURES 

FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL GIVE MUCH GREATER OPERATIONAL CONTROL TO THE 
GARDA' ON DAY-TO-DAY MANAGEMENT AND FOR THE EFFECTIVE ACHIEVEMENT OF AGREED 
OBJECTIVES. 

WE WILL END THE INTERVENTIONIST ROLE WHICH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS 
TRADITIONALLY EXERCISED.

THE GARDA' WILL BE ASSIGNED AGREED OBJECTIVES SUCH AS TARGETED ANNUAL REDUCTIONS 
IN CRIME AND INCREASES IN DETECTION RATES. THEY WILL HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF 
INTERNAL AUTONOMY AND DISCRETION IN DEPLOYING PERSONNEL AND OTHER RESOURCES TO 
ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES. WE WILL REDEFINE THE REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE MINISTER AND THE COMMISSIONER.

FIANNA F‡IL WILL INCREASE GARDA NUMBERS BY 1,200  FROM THE CURRENT STRENGTH OF 
10,800 TO THE FULL COMPLEMENT OF 12,000. WE WILL REVERSE THE POLICY OF THE 
RAINBOW GOVERNMENT AND REPLACE GARDA NUMBERS DEPLETED BY RESIGNATION, DEATH, OR 
RETIREMENT. WE WILL ABOLISH THE UPPER AGE-LIMIT, CURRENTLY AT 26 YEARS, FOR 
RECRUITS.

WE WILL WITHDRAW GARDA' FROM ROUTINE CIVILIAN WORK AND TRAFFIC DUTIES, AND GIVE 
THESE DUTIES TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES. THIS WILL ALLOW MORE GARDA' TO STAFF 
SPECIALIST UNITS AND TO RETURN TO THE BEAT. WE WILL RECRUIT PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE 
TO STAFF ACCOUNTING AND OTHER EXPERT ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES WITHIN THE GARDA'.

WE WILL REASSESS THE PROPOSED GARDA PERFORMANCE DEVELOPMENT & REVIEW SYSTEM. AS 
IT IS, IT IS TOO LIMITED AND CLEARLY SHOWS THAT IT WAS DEVELOPED WITHOUT INPUT 
FROM THE GARDA RANK-AND-FILE. 

FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE THERE IS A NEED FOR A REVIEW OF THE GARDA', TO IDENTIFY THE 
CHANGES REQUIRED TO MAKE THE FORCE FULLY RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF MODERN 
SOCIETY. THE LAST MAJOR REVIEW OF GARDA ORGANISATION WAS NEARLY 20 YEARS AGO, 
AND ONLY PARTS OF THAT REPORT WERE IMPLEMENTED. ANY REVIEW, TO BE SUCCESSFUL, 
MUST INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GARDA'  AT ALL LEVELS. 

SPEEDING UP THE COURTS 

CURRENT COURT PROCEDURES ARE CUMBERSOME AND SLOW, WITH CASES TAKING UP TO 18 
MONTHS TO PROCESS. FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE CLEARED IN THREE MONTHS, 
AND WE WILL CREATE A FAST-TRACK PROSECUTION SYSTEM TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE. SUCH A 
SYSTEM IS IN THE INTERESTS OF BOTH DEFENCE AND PROSECUTION.

FIANNA F‡IL WILL:

ABOLISH THE SYSTEM OF PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION. INSTEAD, AT THE FIRST 
APPEARANCE, IT WILL BE ASCERTAINED WHETHER THE MATTER SHOULD BE DEALT WITH ON 
INDICTMENT. IF SO, IT WILL BE REFERRED DIRECTLY TO THE COURT OF TRIAL.

REORGANISE THE COURT CALENDAR.

REMOVE THE NECESSITY OF ORAL EVIDENCE FROM PURELY FORMAL WITNESSES.

CREATE A STATUTORY BASIS FOR PLEA-BARGAINING, AND SET UP A WITNESS PROTECTION 
PROGRAMME.

FIANNA F‡IL WILL ALSO ACT DECISIVELY TO DEAL WITH THE MORE THAN 7,000 UNEXECUTED 
ARREST WARRANTS IN THE COUNTRY. THESE REPRESENT A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO HELP 
REDUCE CRIME,  AN OPPORTUNITY IGNORED BY THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT.

MAKING OUR COURTS MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT WILL TAKE RESOURCES, BOTH IN 
PERSONNEL AND IN THE UPGRADING OF BUILDINGS. THIS IS A PRICE THAT WE BELIEVE CAN 
NO LONGER BE POSTPONED.

EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF PRISON PLACES 

PRISONERS ARE BEING NOW RELEASED EARLY BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF CELL SPACE. THIS 
SENDS OUT ALL THE WRONG SIGNALS. IT TELLS HARDENED PRISONERS THAT TRUTH IN 
SENTENCING IS A JOKE. IT TELLS POTENTIAL CRIMINALS THAT, EVEN IF THEY ARE 
APPREHENDED, NOT MUCH WILL HAPPEN TO THEM. IT TELLS THE PUBLIC THAT THE SYSTEM 
IS NOT WORKING AND CANNOT GUARANTEE THEM FUNDAMENTAL SECURITY.

FIANNA F‡IL HAVE A CLEAR AND UNEQUIVOCAL PRISONS POLICY.  WE ARE COMMITTED TO 
PROVIDING SUFFICIENT PRISON PLACES, TO MODERNISING PRISON CONDITIONS, AND TO 
ELIMINATING OVERCROWDING. 

WE BELIEVE THAT, WHEN IT COMES TO NEW PRISON CONSTRUCTION, MONEY MUST NEVER BE 
THE DECIDING ISSUE. CITIZEN PROTECTION FROM CRIMINALS IS PARAMOUNT. WE WILL ALSO 
SEVERELY RESTRICT TEMPORARY RELEASE.

FIANNA F‡IL WILL PROVIDE 2,000 ADDITIONAL PRISON PLACES, 1,000 OF THEM IN THE 
FIRST TWO YEARS OF GOVERNMENT.

WE WILL EMBARK ON AN EXTENSIVE PRISON BUILDING PROGRAMME.. 

WE WILL BEGIN CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW REMAND CENTRE AT WHEATFIELD PRISON.

WE WILL SET UP SEPARATE DRUGS TREATMENT DETENTION UNITS. FOR THE DRUG ADDICT, 
THE CHOICE WILL BE CLEAR: TREATMENT OR PRISON.

WE WILL ALSO CONSIDER INNOVATIVE BUILDING PROPOSALS SUCH AS PRIVATE-SECTOR 
FINANCING AND THE INNOVATIVE USE OF SITES AND BUILDINGS.

FIANNA F‡IL WILL SET UP A PRISONS AUTHORITY, WITH OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE 
PRISONS SYSTEM. WE WILL ALSO CREATE AN INDEPENDENT INSPECTORATE OF PRISONS WITH 
POWERS TO INTERVIEW PRISONERS AND, ON APPEAL, HEAR THEIR GRIEVANCES. THE 
INSPECTORATE WILL ALSO HEAR THE GRIEVANCES OF PRISON OFFICERS, HOLD ENQUIRIES, 
EXAMINE CONDITIONS, AND RECOMMEND REFORMS. FIANNA F‡IL WILL ALLOCATE INCREASED 
RESOURCES TO A WELL-TRAINED, WELL EQUIPPED, PROFESSIONAL FORCE OF PRISON 
OFFICERS. THIS WILL GO A LONG WAY TO REDUCE PRISON VIOLENCE AND ESPECIALLY IN 
REDUCING DRUG USE AND ABUSE BY PRISONERS WITHIN PRISON WALLS.








MOBILISING THE COUNTRY AGAINST DRUGS 


FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL

ADOPT A PREVENTATIVE APPROACH TO THE DRUGS PROBLEM RATHER THAN PASSIVELY ACCEPT 
THE INEVITABILITY OF ITS CONTINUED GROWTH

CO-ORDINATE A NATIONAL DRUGS STRATEGY THROUGH A CABINET SUB-COMMITTEE AND A 
MINISTER OF STATE FOR DRUGS

USE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IMAGINATIVELY BY CREATING A DRUG COURT SYSTEM AS AN 
ALTERNATIVE TO THE PRESENT ÔREVOLVING DOORI APPROACH

OFFER NATIONWIDE REHABILITATION SERVICES FOR ADDICTS, AND LINK REHABILITATION TO 
EMPLOYMENT

BE TOUGH AND UNCOMPROMISING TOWARDS DRUG PEDLARS AND PUSHERS

ENCOURAGE OUR EUROPEAN PARTNERS TOWARDS MORE EFFECTIVE CO-OPERATION AGAINST THE 
DRUGS TRADE


 
MOBILISING THE NATION AGAINST DRUGS 

UP TO 80% OF ALL CRIME IN DUBLIN IS RELATED TO DRUGS. SOLUTIONS MUST DEAL WITH 
THE SUPPLIERS, THE PUSHERS AND THE ADDICTS, AND WITH THE NEED TO PROTECT OUR 
COMMUNITIES FROM THE AWFUL INFLUENCES OF THE DRUGS CULTURE.

AS WE STRESS IN OUR POSITION PAPER , A RADICAL APPROACH TO DRUGS AND DRUG 
RELATED CRIME,  THE FIANNA F‡IL STRATEGY  FOR DRUGS AND DRUG RELATED CRIME IS 
FIRMLY BASED ON A PHILOSOPHY OF PREVENTION - DETOXIFICATION - REHABILITATION - 
EMPLOYMENT.

WE WILL, AS A PRIORITY, INVEST IN A PREVENTATIVE APPROACH RATHER THAN ACCEPT THE 
INEVITABILITY OF CONTINUING RECORD LEVELS OF DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION.



FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL GIVE PRIORITY TO INVESTMENT IN EDUCATING OUR 
YOUTH TO COMBAT DRUGS, TO DETOXIFICATION AND REHABILITATION MEASURES AND, FOR 
THE FIRST TIME, WILL LINK REHABILITATED ADDICTS TO JOB TRAINING AND 
PLACEMENT. 

BY INTRODUCING A DRUG COURT PROGRAMME, WE WILL USE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN AN 
IMAGINATIVE WAY TO REHABILITATE ADDICTS CHARGED WITH NON-VIOLENT OFFENCES AND 
REDUCE THE PRISON ÔREVOLVING DOORI FOR DRUG ADDICTS. ADDICTS CHARGED WITH NON-
VIOLENT OFFENCES WILL BE OFFERED A CHOICE OF PROCEEDING TO TRIAL OR 
PARTICIPATING IN A COURT-SUPERVISED STRICT TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION REGIME 
UNDER THE DRUG COURT PROGRAMME.
 
AN INDEPENDENT NATIONAL DRUGS COMMISSION WILL  BE SET UP TO MONITOR THE 
IMPLEMENTATION AND SUCCESS OF THE DRUGS STRATEGY AND TO OVERSEE A CONTINUOUS 
RESEARCH PROGRAMME TO UNDERPIN IT.

PREVENTION AND AWARENESS 

FIANNA F‡IL WILL CO-ORDINATE THE WORK OF ALL RELEVANT GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS IN 
A CABINET SUB-COMMITTEE.  WE WILL APPOINT A MINISTER OF STATE WHOSE SPECIFIC 
BRIEF WILL BE TO ADDRESS THE DRUGS CULTURE AND OTHER JUSTICE MATTERS THAT 
STRADDLE THE DEPARTMENTS OF JUSTICE, EDUCATION AND HEALTH.

WE WILL APPOINT A NATIONAL DRUGS EDUCATION CO-ORDINATOR, AREA DRUGS EDUCATION 
CO-ORDINATORS AT LOCAL LEVEL, AND POSTS OF RESPONSIBILITY IN SECOND LEVEL 
SCHOOLS TO PROMOTE THE SCHOOL RELATED ELEMENTS OF THE NATIONAL DRUG STRATEGY.

IN EACH HEALTH BOARD, FIANNA F‡IL WILL SET UP A SPECIAL COMMITTEE WHOSE TASK 
WILL BE TO ENHANCE EXISTING PROGRAMMES AND TO TRANSLATE THE WORK OF THE CABINET 
SUB-COMMITTEE TO THE LOCAL AND COMMUNITY LEVEL. 

FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE THAT ANY POLICY OF PREVENTION MUST BEGIN WITH THE PEOPLE WHO 
ARE CLOSEST TO THOSE AT RISK: THE PARENTS AND THE TEACHERS. 

MORE RELEVANT ADVISORY PROGRAMMES ON DRUGS WILL BE DEVELOPED IN THE SCHOOLS. 
THESE WILL AIM TO INTEGRATE THE EFFORTS OF TEACHERS, PARENTS, PSYCHOLOGISTS, THE 
HEALTH BOARDS, LOCAL COMMUNITY AND SPORTS ORGANISATIONS, AND COMMUNITY CARE.

WE WILL REINFORCE THE EFFORTS OF LOCAL AND NATIONAL BODIES WITH AN INTENSIVE 
ANTI-DRUGS MEDIA CAMPAIGN.



REHABILITATION 

FIANNA F‡IL WILL ESTABLISH A NATIONAL HOTLINE CENTRE, 
PROPERLY RESOURCED AND STAFFED ON A 24 HOUR BASIS. THE 1-800 NUMBER WILL BE 
AVAILABLE TO PARENTS, YOUNG PEOPLE, SCHOOLS AND EVERYONE SEEKING GUIDANCE AND 
ADVICE.

WE WILL OFFER OUT-PATIENT DETOXIFICATION WITHIN A MAXIMUM WAITING PERIOD OF 2 
WEEKS. FOR THOSE WHO SUCCESSFULLY UNDERGO DETOX AS OUT-PATIENTS, COUN-SELLING 
WILL BE PROVIDED FOR A PERIOD OF 6 MONTHS OR AS CLINICAL NEEDS DICTATE.

WE WILL SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE IN-PATIENT DETOXIFICATION 
FACILITIES PROVIDED BY HEALTH BOARDS. IN THE FIRST PHASE, WE WILL INCREASE 
FOURFOLD THE NUMBER OF BEDS FROM THE CURRENT NATIONAL LEVEL OF ABOUT 25 TO 100. 
ONCE THIS LEVEL IS REACHED, WE WILL EXAMINE THE NEED FOR MORE PROVISION.

WE WILL CONTRIBUTE FINANCIALLY TO THE PROVISION OF ADDITIONAL IN-PATIENT DETOX 
FACILITIES BY PRIVATE INITIATIVES. IN THE FIRST PHASE, WE WILL CREATE 50 EXTRA 
RESIDENTIAL PLACES SERVICING POST-DETOXIFICATION COUNSELLING NEEDS.

WE WILL, IN ADDITION TO DETOXIFICATION, PROVIDE METHADONE MAINTENANCE FOR 
PATIENTS WHO ARE STABILISED. THIS PROVISION WILL BE LINKED TO COUNSELLING 
TOWARDS DETOXIFICATION. METHADONE MAINTENANCE WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR A PERIOD 
OF LONGER THAN 5 YEARS WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF THE NECESSITY OF IT. WE WILL 
ESTABLISH A REGISTER OF ADDICTS RECEIVING METHADONE MAINTENANCE WHICH WILL BE 
MADE ACCESSIBLE TO PHARMACISTS WHO MAY BE ISSUING PRESCRIPTIONS FOR METHADONE.

WE RECOGNISE THAT THERE MAY BE A PLACE FOR MOBILE CLINICS, BUT BELIEVE THEY MUST 
BE LINKED TO THE PROVISION OF ON-GOING COUNSELLING.

WE WILL GIVE PRIORITY ACCESS TO IN-PATIENT DETOX BEDS TO MOTHERS WILLING TO BE 
DETOXIFIED DURING PREGNANCY. WE WILL PROVIDE BEDS FOR CASES OF MOTHER AND BABY 
DETOXIFICATION IN MATERNITY UNITS OR IN AN IN-PATIENT DETOXIFICATION UNIT.

WE BELIEVE THAT FULL TREATMENT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR DRUG ADDICTS IN PRISON. 
WE WILL CREATE A DRUG-FREE TREATMENT UNIT WHICH COULD BE PURPOSE BUILT OR 
CONVERTED FROM EXISTING FACILITIES.

WE WILL EXPAND THE NUMBER OF CONSULTANT PSYCHIATRISTS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE 
LARGE NUMBER OF DRUG ADDICTS. ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL SUCH AS JUNIOR
DOCTORS, SOCIAL WORKERS AND COUNSELLORS WILL ALSO BE PROVIDED.


WE BELIEVE THAT STUDIES OF THE PREVALENCE OF ALL TYPES OF DRUG MIS-USE ARE 
ESSENTIAL IF SERVICES ARE TO BE TAILORED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ADDICTS. OUR 
INDEPENDENT NATIONAL COMMISSION ON DRUG ABUSE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ORGANISING 
THIS RESEARCH.

FROM REHABILITATION TO EMPLOYMENT 

FIANNA F‡IL WILL LINK THE FULL RANGE OF STATE TRAINING AND JOB PLACEMENT 
SERVICES TO THE NATIONAL DRUGS POLICY, SO THAT A PERSON WHO COMES OUT OF DETOX 
OR REHABILITATION WILL BE OFFERED A CONSTRUCTIVE ROUTE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
HIS CAREER AND LIFE AFTER DRUGS.

WE WILL ENSURE THAT LOCAL EMPLOYMENT SERVICES DEVELOP SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS TO 
ASSIST RECOVERING DRUG ADDICTS COMING FROM DETOX OR REHAB SERVICES AND WHO WANT 
TO GET A JOB. WE WILL ALLOCATE TRAINING AND COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT PLACES TO 
RECOVERING ADDICTS.

WE WILL STRONGLY ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT, WITH A CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS CAPITAL 
FUNDING AND OPERATIONAL EXPENSES, TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT INITIATIVES FOR 
RECOVERING DRUG ADDICTS WITHIN A BUSINESS-LIKE COMPANY OR CO-OPERATIVE 
STRUCTURE.

TRAFFICKING IN DRUGS 

AGAINST DRUG PEDLARS AND PUSHERS, FIANNA F‡IL WILL BE TOUGH AND UNCOMPROMISING. 
WE WILL:

BRING IN MANDATORY 10-YEAR MINIMUM SENTENCES FOR THOSE CAUGHT IN 
POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED DRUGS WITH A STREET VALUE OF OVER £10,000.

LEGISLATE TO PERMIT THE IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION OR FORFEITURE OF THE LICENCE OF ANY 
PREMISES  PUB, CLUB, OR DISCO  WHERE CONTROLLED DRUGS ARE DISTRIBUTED, REPLACING 
THE RUSHED AND INADEQUATE MEASURE INTRODUCED IN THIS AREA BY THE RAINBOW 
GOVERNMENT.

STREAMLINE THE COURTS SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT THE TRIAL OF DRUG-DEALING OFFENCES 
WILL TAKE PLACE WITHIN 90 DAYS OF ARREST.

CONFISCATE THE PROFITS OF THE DRUGS BARONS, USING THE FULL POWERS NOW 
AVAILABLE THROUGH THE FIANNA F‡IL-INITIATED LEGISLATION ON ILLICIT ASSETS.

SET UP AN UNDERCOVER UNIT FOR DRUGS DETECTION.

DEDICATE MORE GARDA RESOURCES TO COMBATING DRUG TRAFFICKING.

BE A PRIME MOVER IN ENCOURAGING OUR EUROPEAN PARTNERS TOWARDS GREATER CO-
OPERATION ON DRUGS AND ORGANISED CRIME.


MAKING AN ALL-OUT ASSAULT ON DISADVANTAGE

FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL

BRING NEW URGENCY, NEW RESOURCES AND NEW IDEAS TO ATTACK THE PROBLEM 
OF DISADVANTAGE

BUILD STRONG COMMUNITIES, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL PEOPLE AND 
VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS

TARGET SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO DISADVANTAGE, AND MONITOR EFFECTIVENESS

CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE, NATIONWIDE PROGRAMME TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE LONG-TERM 
UNEMPLOYED GET BACK TO WORK

REORGANISE AND REFOCUS THE SOCIAL WELFARE SYSTEM, PERMITTING US TO 
EXTEND THE CARING SOCIETY

ACCELERATE ACTION CONCERNING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

CREATE A NEW DEAL FOR THE TRAVELLING COMMUNITY

ATTACK FRAUD AND ABUSE IN SOCIAL WELFARE, FREEING UP RESOURCES TO ADDRESS REAL 
NEEDS
 
 
TACKLING DISADVANTAGE THE TIME IS NOW

FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE THAT DISADVANTAGE IN OUR SOCIETY CAN NO LONGER BE TOLERATED. 
IRISH PEOPLE WANT PROSPERITY, BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF THOSE WHO ARE GENUINELY 
IN NEED OR DISADVANTAGED. NEITHER DO IRISH PEOPLE WANT A SOCIETY THAT IS AT WAR 
WITH ITSELF, BECAUSE OF GROWING GAPS BETWEEN THE ÔHAVESI AND ÔHAVE NOTSI. AS WE 
APPROACH THE NEW MILLENNIUM, WE MUST PLAN TO MEET THE URGENT NEEDS OF OUR 
CHANGING SOCIETY.

EVEN IN BAD TIMES, FIANNA F‡IL HAVE ALWAYS MADE EXTRA PROVISION FOR THOSE IN 
NEED. NOW THAT BETTER TIMES HAVE ARRIVED, WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE 
OUTSTANDING NEEDS OF THOSE WHO STILL DO NOT BENEFIT FROM OUR NEW PROSPERITY. 
FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE IT IS VITAL TO GRASP THAT OPPORTUNITY IN THE LIFETIME OF THE 
NEXT GOVERNMENT.
 
BUILDING STRONG COMMUNITIES THROUGH 
PARTNERSHIP 

STRONG WELL-DEVELOPED COMMUNITIES PROVIDE BETTER OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILDREN AND 
OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS, WHILE ENABLING THE PEOPLE AS WELL AS THE LOCAL ECONOMY TO 
GROW MORE FREE OF CRIME. 

FIANNA F‡IL INITIATED ALMOST ALL THE PRESENT SUPPORTS FOR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT 
AND PARTNERSHIP GROUPS, WOMEN, MEN AND FAMILY GROUPS AND LOCAL DEVELOPMENT 
PROJECTS.

THESE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL, BUT THEY ARE ONLY A FIRST STEP. ITIS NOW TIME TO 
INVEST MORE IN THE PARISH AND THE COMMUNITY, SO AS TO MAKE EQUALITY OF 
OPPORTUNITY A REALITY FOR ALL.

FIANNA F‡IL WILL 

CREATE AN INTENSIVE SUPPORT PLAN FOR PARISHES AND COMMUNITIES IN DISADVAN-TAGED 
AREAS. THE STATE WILL ENTER INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM TO HELP BUILD STRONG 
LOCAL COMMUNITIES, PROVIDING RESOURCES NECESSARY FOR INVESTMENT. THIS WILL 
INCLUDE EXTENDING THE LIFE-SPAN OF THE LOCAL AREA PARTNERSHIP COMPANIES CREATED 
BY FIANNA F‡IL INTO THE NEW MILLENNIUM, THROUGH A COMBINATION OF EU FUNDING AND 
NATIONAL RESOURCES. THE LOCAL AREA PARTNERSHIPS HAVE DEMON-STRATED THEIR 
EFFECTIVENESS AND RESPONSIVENESS TO LOCAL COMMUNITY NEEDS AND WILL HAVE A 
SPECIAL ROLE IN REACHING OUT TO THOSE EXCLUDED FROM THE WORKFORCE, WHETHER ON 
THE LIVE REGISTER OR NOT.

AWARD COMMUNITY CONTRACTS TO DEVELOP RECREATIONAL, SPORTING, EDUCATIONAL AND 
DEVELOPMENTAL ACTIVITIES ON A PARISH AND COMMUNITY BASIS. THIS WILL BE DONE IN 
PARTNERSHIP WITH NATIONAL AGENCIES SUCH AS THE NATIONAL COMMUNITY GAMES, THE 
GAA, THE FAI AND AMATEUR LEAGUES, THE SCOUTING MOVEMENT, AND THE SOCIETY OF ST. 
VINCENT DE PAUL. THE WORK THESE ORGANISATIONS DO AT LOCAL LEVEL IS A CORNERSTONE 
OF OUR SOCIETY, BUT IT IS NOT GIVEN ADEQUATE RECOG-NITION OR SCOPE. FIANNA F‡IL 
WILL GIVE THAT RECOGNITION AND THE EXTRA RESOURCES TO MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE IN 
AREAS OF GREATEST NEED.

DEVELOP SPECIALISED INVESTMENT PROGRAMMES FOR WOMENIS GROUPS, MENIS GROUPS, AND 
FAMILY SUPPORT GROUPS. WE WILL PROVIDE FAMILY SUPPORT FOR: 
TODDLERS, INVOLVING PARENTS WITH CHILDREN;
UNDER 5 YEAR OLDS, WHERE CHILD 
NURSERIES AND COURSES IN PARENT DEVELOPMENT ARE NEEDED; 
5-12 YEAR OLDS, WHO NEED SPECIAL SUPPORT IN SCHOOL AND THE COMMUNITY; TEENAGERS, 
WHO NEED COUNSELLING, SUPPORT, INVOLVEMENT, DIRECTION AND PARENTING.
WE WILL GIVE UNEMPLOYED SPOUSES SPECIAL INCENTIVES TO TAKE PART IN THEIR OWN 
PARISH AND COMMUNITY 
DEVELOPMENT PLAN. FATHERS ON THE DOLE WILL HAVE A SPECIAL PART TO PLAY IN 
BUILDING A FUTURE WITH REAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE CHILDREN OF THEIR AREA. WE 
WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP CHILD BENEFIT AS A KEY SUPPORT FOR EVERY CHILD IN THE 
STATE AND INCREASE THE PAYMENT TO MOTHERS OF TWINS.

TARGET SPECIFIC RESOURCES ON DISADVANTAGE, AND MONITOR 
EFFECTIVENESS 

WHEN RESOURCES ARE DIFFUSED AND DISPERSED THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IS DILUTED, AND 
MONITORING THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IS MORE DIFFICULT. FIANNA F‡IL WILL  TARGET 0.5% 
OF THE ENTIRE SOCIAL WELFARE ESTIMATE, IN A STRINGENTLY ACCOUNTABLE MANNER, 
TOWARDS ADDITIONAL PROJECTS AIMED AT ELIMINATING DISADVANTAGE. THESE PROJECTS, 
WHICH WILL CUT ACROSS THE BOUNDARIES OF GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AS NECESSARY, 
INCLUDE:

RE-TRAINING AND CAREER-ORIENTED ADULT EDUCATION, ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE 
LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED. FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE THAT REAL PROGRESS IN 
ELIMINATING POVERTY CAN ONLY BE MADE BY PLACING PEOPLE IN JOBS.

DRUG PREVENTION AND REHABILITATION INITIATIVES.

A DECISIVE ATTACK ON THE GROWING PROBLEM OF HOMELESSNESS,  WHICH IN MANY WAYS IS 
THE MOST PROFOUND MANIFESTATION OF POVERTY.

IMPROVED SERVICES TO TACKLE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND ITS DIRE CONSEQUENCES, 
ESPECIALLY FOR  WOMEN AND CHILDREN.

FUNDING CONTRACTS WITH VOLUNTARY GROUPS TO PROVIDE RECREATIONAL, SPORTING, 
EDUCATIONAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL ACTIVITIES.


HELPING PEOPLE WHO ARE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED GET BACK TO WORK 

FIANNA F‡IL WILL PUT IN PLACE A NATIONWIDE PROGRAMME TO TACKLE LONG-TERM 
UNEMPLOYMENT. THE ELEMENTS WILL INCLUDE:

A 25,000-PLACE PROGRAMME TO TACKLE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT WHICH WILL PAY THE 
GOING RATE FOR THE JOB. IT WILL BE RUN ON THE SAME BASIS AS THE 
PROGRAMME OPERATED BY THE CONFERENCE OF RELIGIOUS (CORI).
SECOND CHANCE EDUCATION;

EXPANDING THE JOB-FACILITATOR PROGRAMME AND THE LOCAL EMPLOYMENT SERVICE, TO 
HELP UNEMPLOYED 
PEOPLE AVAIL OF BACK-TO-WORK OPTIONS;

EXTENDING THE PRSI EXEMPTION SCHEME;

A TAX ALLOWANCE FOR LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE WHO MOVE INTO 
EMPLOYMENT, AND DOUBLE TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR THEIR EMPLOYER;

WIDE-SCALE USE OF COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT SCHEMES; WE WILL ALSO ALLOCATE UP TO 10% 
OF COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING OPTIONS TO WOMEN IN THE HOME, INCLUDING 
WIDOWS ON THE SOCIAL WELFARE INSURANCE PENSION AND WOMEN ON DESERTED WIVESI 
BENEFIT;

A PROGRAMME TO ENABLE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE TO WORK WITH 
VOLUNTARY AND COMMUNITY ORGANISATIONS;

A STRONG FAMILY DIMENSION IN SCHEMES ENCOURAGING UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE AND THEIR 
SPOUSES TO RETURN TO WORK, TO STRENGTHEN THE POSITION OF BOTH PARENTS AS ROLE 
MODELS FOR THEIR CHILDREN;

EXTENDING THE FAMILY INCOME SUPPLEMENT, OVER  TIME, TO SELF-EMPLOYED 
PEOPLE;

SETTING UP A ÒHOME TO BUSINESSÓ REGISTER WHICH WILL ALLOW ANYONE WORKING FULL-
TIME AT HOME FOR A SPECIFIC PERIOD TO QUALIFY FOR STATE TRAINING PRO-GRAMMES AND 
TO BE RECOGNISED AS CONTRIBUTORS TO ECONOMIC WELL-BEING;

INTRODUCING A MINIMUM WAGE; FOLLOWING SIMILAR MOVES IN BRITAIN, FIANNA F‡IL WILL 
INTRODUCE A MINIMUM WAGE TO PREVENT EXPLOITATION IN LOW-PAID HOURLY EMPLOYMENT, 
ESPECIALLY OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND WOMEN.

REORGANISING AND REFOCUSING THE SOCIAL WELFARE SYSTEM
 
FIANNA F‡IL  WILL CARRY OUT A ROOT-AND-BRANCH REORGANISATION OF THE DEPARTMENT 
OF SOCIAL WELFARE, SO THAT IT PLAYS THE MOST EFFECTIVE ROLE POSSIBLE IN 
SUPPORTING PEOPLE, FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES.

WE WILL CREATE A NEW BOARD TO SUPERVISE THE FINANCING AND OPERATION OF THE 
SOCIAL INSURANCE FUND. THIS FUND IS THE WORKERSI GUARANTEE THAT THEIR BENEFITS 
WILL BE THERE FOR THEM WHEN NEEDED, WITHOUT INTERFERENCE OR MEANS TESTING. BOARD 
MEMBERS WILL INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES OF EMPLOYERS, EMPLOYEES, SELF-EMPLOYED 
PEOPLE, RETIRED PEOPLE AND OTHER INTERESTED GROUPS. AN ACTUARIAL ASSESSMENT OF 
THE FUND AND ITS FUTURE NEEDS WILL BE PLACED BEFORE D‡IL ƒIREANN AT LEAST EVERY 
THREE YEARS.

WE WILL ENHANCE THE ROLE OF COMMUNITY, VOLUNTARY AND FAMILY GROUPS IN OUR 
SOCIETY, DEVELOPING THEIR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATUTORY AGENCIES AND SUPPORTING 
THEM THROUGH PROPERLY-FUNDED 3-YEAR PLANS.

WE WILL GREATLY IMPROVE THE INFORMATION NETWORK FOR CUSTOMERS AND CREATE 
ADDITIONAL CUSTOMER PANELS TO MAINTAIN DIRECT CONTACT WITH PARTICULAR GROUPS.

WE WILL REFORM PAYMENT SYSTEMS TO PUT  THE NEEDS OF SOCIAL WELFARE CUSTOMERS 
FIRST, AND MAKE ASSISTANCE AND ADVICE ON BUDGETING MUCH MORE WIDELY 
AVAILABLE.

WE WILL ASSESS THE ADEQUACY IN TODAYIS CIRCUMSTANCES OF ALL AGENCIES WHICH CARRY 
OUT THE WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT.

WE WILL RENAME THE DEPARTMENT AS ÒTHE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL, COMMUNITY AND FAMILY 
AFFAIRSÓ TO REFLECT ITS WIDER ROLE IN THE NEW MILLENNIUM. WE WILL APPOINT A 
MINISTER OF STATE FOR FAMILY AFFAIRS. THE NEW FAMILY FOCUS IN SOCIAL WELFARE IS 
DESIGNED TO PUT FAMILIES AT THE HEART OF OUR POLICY-MAKING. IT WILL PROVIDE A 
FOCAL POINT THROUGH WHICH WE CAN MONITOR THE OUTCOME OF SOCIAL POLICIES AS THEY 
AFFECT FAMILIES.

A BETTER DEAL FOR WOMEN AND OLDER PEOPLE

FIANNA F‡IL WILL INTRODUCE FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF WOMEN AND 
OLDER PEOPLE. THESE WILL INCLUDE:

ENSURING THE SOCIAL WELFARE PROVISIONS NOT ONLY KEEP PACE WITH INFLATION, BUT 
THAT OUR PENSIONERS SHARE IN OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH.

RAISING, OVER THREE YEARS, THE PERSONAL RATES OF PENSIONS FOR WIDOWS AND 
WIDOWERS OVER 66 TO THE RATE OF THE OLD AGE CONTRIBUTORY PENSION.

ENSURING THAT BY THE NEW MILLENNIUM ALL WOMEN WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET AN 
OCCUPATIONAL PENSION. IN 1994, FIANNA F‡IL RECOGNISED THE TIME SPENT BY MOTHERS 
CARING FOR CHILDREN, AN OLDER PERSON OR A PERSON WITH A DISABILITY. FIANNA F‡IL 
ALSO BROUGHT SELF-EMPLOYED WOMEN, AND THE SPOUSES OF SELF-EMPLOYED PEOPLE, INTO 
OLD AGE AND SURVIVORSI PENSIONS.

PROVIDING PENSIONS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT TO WOMEN IN THE HOME WHO ARE DEPENDANT, 
AND MAKING FLEXIBLE ARRANGEMENTS TO MEET THE CHANGING NEEDS OF WOMEN.
PROVIDING SOCIAL INSURANCE CREDITS TO WOMEN CARING FOR CHILDREN, OLDER PEOPLE OR 
THOSE WITH DISABILITIES, AND TO WOMEN WHO WORK ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS IN THEIR 
LOCAL COMMUNITY.

PROVIDING FOR A SYSTEM OF VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS FOR WOMEN IN THE HOME.

ENSURING THAT IRELAND TAKES THE LEAD IN PROVIDING ADEQUATE PENSIONS FOR PART-
TIME WORKERS, MAINLY WOMEN, WHO DO NOT HAVE OCCUPATIONAL PENSIONS AT PRESENT.

MAKING NEW ARRANGEMENTS TO TACKLE THE PROBLEMS FACED BY PEOPLE WHO WERE 
MARGINALLY EXCLUDED FROM PARTICIPATION IN PRSI PENSIONS.

TACKLING FRAUD AND ABUSE IN SOCIAL WELFARE

ABUSE OF THE SOCIAL WELFARE SYSTEM IS A PARTICULARLY SERIOUS FRAUD, SINCE IT 
REDUCES OUR ABILITY TO CATER FOR REAL NEED. FIANNA F‡IL WILL ATTACK FRAUD AND 
ABUSE IN AN INTEGRATED AND CONSISTENT WAY, IN CONTRAST TO THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE 
PRESENT MINISTER FOR SOCIAL WELFARE WHO FIRST DENIED THERE WAS A PROBLEM AT ALL, 
AND IS NOW CLAIMING CREDIT FOR FALLS IN THE LIVE REGISTER FOLLOWING HIS BELATED 
ACTION.

WE WILL

USE FULLY THE ENHANCED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM AND OUR OVERALL REVIEW OF 
THE DEPARTMENT TO EXTRACT QUALITY INFORMATION ON THE POTENTIAL FOR FRAUD WITHIN 
EACH PROGRAMME; 

MAKE TECHNICAL CHANGES, WHERE NECESSARY, TO REDUCE THE VULNERABILITY TO ABUSE OF 
EACH PROGRAMME;

ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF CURRENT PENALTIES FOR ABUSE, AND EXAMINE THE POTENTIAL 
FOR A HIGHER LEVEL OF DETERRENCE;

QUANTIFY SAVINGS WHICH CAN BE ACHIEVED FROM BETTER FRAUD DETECTION AND 
PREVENTION;

CLOSELY CO-OPERATE WITH FÇS AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES ON THE PROVISION OF WORK 
OPTIONS AND JOBS.




ACCELERATING ACTION CONCERNING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES 

FIANNA F‡IL WILL GIVE PRIORITY TO ACTION ON ISSUES OF CONCERN TO 
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES. THERE IS A CLEAR NEED TO PROMOTE 
INDIVIDUAL CHOICE AND ENSURE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL POTENTIAL, THROUGH A 
SYSTEM OF INDIVIDUAL EMPOWERMENT COUPLED WITH CONSULTATION.

IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE DEMEDICALISE SOCIAL ISSUES SUCH AS DISABILITY. ACCESS TO 
SERVICES WILL BECOME PART OF THE REMIT OF ALL STATE AGENCIES. WE WILL FOSTER 
INNOVATION IN SERVICE PROVISION, POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND REPRESENTATION. 

FIANNA F‡IL WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF EQUALITY LEGISLATION FOR 
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WE ALSO SUPPORT THE INTRODUCTION OF DISABILITY 
PROOFING LEGISLATION, AND WILL WORK TO ENSURE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF ACTION ON 
DISABILITY IS EXPLICITLY RECOGNISED IN EUROPEAN UNION TREATIES.

WHERE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY OR THROUGH NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS, WE 
WILL CREATE A MORE STABLE FUNDING ENVIRONMENT WITH TRANSPARENT PROCEDURES, 
MULTI-ANNUAL CONTRACTS AND RECOGNITION OF THE NEED TO SUPPORT CORE STAFF AND 
ACTIVITY COSTS.

WE WILL ACT ON THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT MANY CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES 
WOULD BENEFIT FROM ENROLMENT IN MAINSTREAM SCHOOLS IF PROVIDED WITH ACCESSIBLE 
FACILITIES AND SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. 

WE WILL ALSO AIM TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES HAVE THE SAME 
OPPORTUNITY AS OTHER CHILDREN TO PARTICIPATE IN PRE-SCHOOL EDUCATION.

WE WILL UNDERTAKE A COMPLETE REVIEW OF THE PROVISION OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING FOR 
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, AND ENSURE THAT A RANGE OF EMPLOYMENT OPTIONS SUITED 
TO INDIVIDUAL NEEDS ARE AVAILABLE. 

WE WILL OVERHAUL THE MEANS BY WHICH THE STATE SUPPORTS THE INCOMES OF PEOPLE 
WITH DISABILITIES AND REDUCE UNNECESSARY BUREAUCRACY IN DEALING WITH HEALTH 
AGENCIES. 

THE OBJECTIVE OF OUR HOUSING POLICY FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WILL BE TO 
ENSURE THE AVAILABILITY OF A RANGE OF OPTIONS INCLUDING ADAPTED PRIVATE HOUSING, 
SUPPORTED INDEPENDENT LIVING UNITS, SHELTERED HOUSING AND FULL CARE RESIDENTIAL 
UNITS. WE WILL PROVIDE PERSONAL ASSISTANCE FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING.

WE WILL INTRODUCE A COORDINATED AND COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO PROMOTING ACCESS 
BY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES TO THE USE OF PUBLIC SPACES AND FACILITIES, AND TO 
THE WHOLE OF THE TRANSPORT CHAIN.


A NEW DEAL FOR THE TRAVELLING COMMUNITY

IT IS ESTIMATED THAT A TOTAL OF 3,100 ADDITIONAL UNITS OF ACCOMMODATION IS 
NEEDED BY THE YEAR 2000 IF ALL TRAVELLERS REQUIRING ACCOMMODATION ARE TO BE 
FACILITATED. THERE ARE NOW ABOUT 1,125 FAMILIES LIVING ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD 
WITH NOWHERE TO GO, OFTEN IN APPALLING AND DANGEROUS CONDITIONS.

FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE THAT THE TIME HAS NOW COME FOR THE COMMUNITY TO COME TO 
GRIPS WITH THE PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN FULLY INTEGRATING THE TRAVELLING COMMUNITY 
WITHIN THE FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY. 

TO OVERCOME YEARS OF DISCRIMINATION, NEGLECT AND INDIFFERENCE, FIANNA F‡IL WILL 
ENSURE THAT ALL RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE TASK FORCE ON THE TRAVELLING COMMUNITY 
WILL BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED WITHIN FIVE YEARS.

WE WILL ASSIGN A MINISTER OF STATE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CO-ORDINATING THE 
POLICY IMPLEMENTATION, ESPECIALLY TO ENSURE THAT EACH GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT 
MEETS THE SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVES EACH YEAR IN THEIR AREAS OF 
RESPONSIBILITY.

WE WILL LAY BEFORE THE D‡IL EACH YEAR A REPORT ON THE PROGRESS MADE ON THE 5-
YEAR IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMME.

CONTINUING THE CARING TRADITION

TODAY MORE THAN EVER, SOCIAL WELFARE HAS A PIVOTAL ROLE IN MAINTAINING SOCIAL 
COHESION IN OUR SOCIETY. FIANNA F‡IL HAVE A PROUD RECORD IN IMPROVING SUPPORT 
FOR THOSE WHO ARE LEAST ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES. 

MOST OF THE INNOVATIVE MEASURES WHICH ARE PART OF OUR PROVISIONS TODAY WERE 
CREATED BY FIANNA F‡IL.  THESE RANGE FROM FREE TRAVEL FOR OLDER PEOPLE AND 
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES TO THE CARERIS ALLOWANCE, THE BACK-TO-WORK ALLOWANCE, 
SECOND-CHANCE EDUCATION FOR UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE, AND SUPPORT FOR THE MANY WOMENIS 
GROUPS, COMMUNITY PROJECTS AND VOLUNTARY SERVICES.

MUCH HAS BEEN ACHIEVED, PARTICULARLY IN THE  LAST TEN YEARS. THE NATION NOW 
SPENDS £4.5 BILLION EACH YEAR ON SOCIAL WELFARE. 

MANY OF THE TARGETS SET BY THE COMMISSION ON SOCIAL WELFARE HAVE ALREADY BEEN 
MET. 
EQUALLY, HOWEVER, WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MANY OF THE CURRENT RATES OF SOCIAL 
WELFARE ARE ONLY ENOUGH TO PROVIDE A MINIMAL STANDARD OF LIVING FOR RECIPIENTS 
AND THEIR FAMILIES. FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE THERE IS NO ROOM FOR EITHER COMPLACENCY 
OR BEGRUDGERY WHEN EVALUATING CURRENT LEVELS OF SOCIAL WELFARE PAYMENTS.

PEOPLE WHOSE NEEDS ARE GREATEST INCLUDE THE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED, OLDER PEOPLE,  
WIDOWS, FAMILIES AND ESPECIALLY LARGER FAMILIES, HOMELESS PEOPLE, PEOPLE WITH 
DISABILITIES AND CARERS.

AS FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS, WE WILL:

PROVIDE A 3-MONTH BEREAVEMENT ALLOWANCE DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF BEREAVEMENT, 
WHERE A PERSON IS IN RECEIPT OF A SOCIAL WELFARE 
BENEFIT OR ASSISTANCE PAYMENT, AND EITHER THAT PERSON OR AN ADULT DEPENDANT 
DIES;

EXTEND NATIONWIDE THE HIGHER RATE OF FREE FUEL ALLOWANCE AND INCLUDE THOSE IN 
RECEIPT OF THE NEW SICKNESS ALLOWANCE AT THE LONG-TERM RATE;

EASE AND SIMPLIFY THE MEANS TEST FOR SMALLHOLDERS AND FISHERMEN; GIVE WIDOWS, 
OLD-AGE AND INVALIDITY PENSIONERS AND PEOPLE ON DISABILITY ALLOWANCES SIMILAR 
BENEFICIAL MEANS ALLOWANCES AS TO LONE PARENTS; REVIEW THE ASSESSMENT OF 
SAVINGS AND INTEREST CHARGES, AND ENCOURAGE SPECIAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS OF UP TO 
£10,000 WHICH WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO MEANS TESTING, IN THE INTERESTS OF 
SECURITY FOR OLDER PEOPLE; EXTEND THE CARERIS ALLOWANCE TO INCLUDE THOSE WHO 
CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH A SEVERE DISABILITY.

FIANNA F‡IL WILL ACHIEVE THE BALANCE NEEDED TO MEET OUR VISION OF INCREASING 
PROSPERITY FOR EVERYONE WITHOUT EXCEPTION.
 

BRINGING GOVERNMENT CLOSER TO THE PEOPLE

FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL

FOCUS PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION ON THE NEEDS OF THE CUSTOMER

REVITALISE THE PUBLIC SERVICE THROUGH BEST-PRACTICE MANAGEMENT

CREATE A SYSTEM OF REAL LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME

MAKE THE OIREACHTAS MORE RELEVANT TO THE EVERYDAY CONCERNS OF CITIZENS

EXTEND THE VOTE TO EMIGRANTS

RESTORE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN POLITICS THROUGH A CREDIBLE POLICING MECHANISM FOR 
ETHICAL ISSUES
 

FOCUSING PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION ON THE CUSTOMER 

FIANNA F‡IL WILL MAKE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION MORE RELEVANT TO THE LIFE OF THE 
CITIZEN, FOR WHOM THE SERVICE EXISTS.

PUBLIC OFFICES. WE WILL IMPROVE PHYSICAL ACCESS TO PUBLIC OFFICES AND UPGRADE 
THEIR ENVIRONMENT, AND INCREASE AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES THROUGH STAGGERED OR 
EXTENDED OPENING HOURS. WE WILL MAKE THINGS  EASIER FOR THE PUBLIC THROUGH 
BETTER SIGN-POSTING OF SERVICES, ONE-STOP SHOPS FOR ALL GOVERNMENT SERVICES, AND 
RECIPROCAL CASE HANDLING ARRANGEMENTS. WE WILL UPGRADE STAFF TRAINING IN SKILLS 
RELATING TO DEALING WITH CUSTOMERS.

OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS. WE WILL MAKE OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS MORE ACCESSIBLE. 
STAFF WILL BE TRAINED TO USE SIMPLE LANGUAGE; WE WILL MAKE MORE UNDERSTANDABLE 
THE LANGUAGE IN LEGAL TEXTS; COMMUNICATIONS WILL BE PERSONALISED AND RESPONSE 
TIMES TO ENQUIRIES WILL BE CONTROLLED AND MINIMISED. A FORM AUDIT UNIT WILL 
MONITOR ALL OFFICIAL FORMS FOR CLARITY AND EASE OF USE FOR THE CUSTOMER, 
IMPOSING CHANGES WHERE NECESSARY.

INFORMATION. FIANNA F‡IL WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO 
THE PUBLIC, USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND SPECIALIST INFORMATION CENTRES. 
WE WILL INCREASE FEEDBACK FROM CUSTOMERS THROUGH OPINION POLLS, SELF-REPORTING 
SYSTEMS, OPEN DOOR AND ROUND TABLE CONFERENCES.

COMPLAINTS. WE WILL IMPROVE IN-HOUSE APPEAL  PROCEDURES THROUGHOUT THE PUBLIC 
SERVICE, AND EXAMINE THE AREAS WHICH ARE AT PRESENT OFF-LIMITS TO THE OMBUDSMAN. 

BREAKING DOWN BUREAUCRACY. WE WILL REGROUP AGENCIES TO REFLECT CUSTOMER NEEDS 
RATHER THAN ADMINISTRATIVE CONVENIENCE. 

WE WILL LOCALISE AND DECENTRALISE SERVICES, DEVOLVE POLICY IMPLEMENTATION TO 
LOWER LEVEL AUTHORITIES, AND CARRY OUT A PROGRAMME OF DEREGULATION AIMED AT 
CUTTING BACK UNNECESSARY REGULATION.

REVITALISING THE PUBLIC SERVICE THROUGH BEST-PRACTICE 
MANAGEMENT

FIANNA F‡IL WILL DEVELOP A NEW DYNAMIC IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND FOSTER A 
PROACTIVE AND INNOVATIVE SPIRIT.

OUR POLICY ON ENTERING GOVERNMENT WILL BE TO IMMEDIATELY LEGISLATE TO REMOVE THE 
OBSTRUCTIONS AND BARRIERS WHICH HAVE RESTRICTED THE POTENTIAL PERFORMANCE AND 
JOB SATISFACTION OF MANY PUBLIC SERVANTS.

FIANNA F‡IL WILL RELEASE THIS POTENTIAL BY ENSURING THAT INDIVIDUAL PUBLIC 
SERVANTS ARE GIVEN EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO USE THEIR CREATIVITY AND PERSONAL 
ABILITIES TO PROVIDE A 
BETTER SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC. 

THIS WILL BE DONE THROUGH STRUCTURED MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, BASED ON BEST PRACTICE. 
THIS WILL ENSURE THAT THERE WILL BE NO PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY WITHOUT EQUAL 
AUTHORITY AND NO AUTHORITY WITHOUT EQUAL RESPONSIBILITY. GOOD JOB PERFORMANCE 
WILL BE WELL REWARDED AND EXCELLENT JOB PERFORMANCE MORE HIGHLY REWARDED. 

THIS APPROACH WILL CARRY FORWARD THE STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE, WHICH WAS 
INTRODUCED BY FIANNA F‡IL.

CREATING A SYSTEM OF REAL LOCAL GOVERNMENT

FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE THAT A CENTRAL PART OF BRINGING GOVERNMENT CLOSER TO THE 
PEOPLE IS TO REFORM RADICALLY OUR SYSTEM OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. 



SINCE INDEPENDENCE OUR GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN OVER-CENTRALISED BY INTERNATIONAL 
STANDARDS, WITH LITTLE REAL POWER DEVOLVED TO LOCAL LEVEL. PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO 
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE HAVE NOT BEEN BACKED BY A DRIVING POLITICAL WILL, AND 
THEREFORE NOTHING HAS HAPPENED.

FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE THAT THE TIME HAS NOW COME TO GRASP THIS NETTLE, AND GIVE 
THE 
PEOPLE CONTROL OVER MORE OF THEIR AFFAIRS AT LOCAL LEVEL.

OUR AIM IS TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM OF DEMOCRATIC DECISION-MAKING WHICH HARNESSES THE 
ENERGY OF ALL CITIZENS AND MAXIMISES THEIR CAPACITY TO SHAPE THE FUTURE 
DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR COMMUNITIES.

TO ACHIEVE THIS, THE NEW LOCAL GOVERNMENT SYSTEM WILL:

BE STRUCTURED SO AS TO ENCOURAGE MAXIMUM PARTICIPATION BY PEOPLE IN 
DECISIONS THAT AFFECTS THEIR LIVES;

RESPOND FLEXIBLY TO LOCAL NEEDS, AND HAVE THE FINANCIAL CAPABILITY TO DO SO 
ADEQUATELY;

OPERATE THE PRINCIPLE OF SUBSIDIARITY, THAT IS, PROVIDE SERVICES AT THE LOWEST 
LEVEL AT WHICH THEY CAN BE DELIVERED EFFICIENTLY;

NOURISH A VIBRANT AND HEALTHY LOCAL ECONOMY;

ALLOCATE RESPONSIBILITY AND RESOURCES, WHEREVER PRACTICABLE, TO THE PEOPLE 
AFFECTED.

AS PART OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL PACKAGE, FIANNA F‡IL WILL CAP LEVELS 
BY WHICH LOCAL AUTHORITIES CAN RAISE COMMERCIAL RATES EACH YEAR.

FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL CONSULT WIDELY WITH ALL THE INTERESTS INVOLVED, 
AND WITHIN THE LIFETIME OF THE NEXT GOVERNMENT BEGIN THIS RADICAL TRANSFORMATION 
IN THE STRUCTURE OF HOW WE GOVERN OURSELVES.

MAKING THE OIREACHTAS MORE RELEVANT TO EVERYDAY CONCERNS 

FIANNA F‡IL WHEN IN GOVERNMENT HAVE DONE MOST TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN 
OIREACHTAS REFORM. ON RETURN TO GOVERNMENT WE WILL PROGRESS REFORM TO ENSURE 
THAT PROCEDURES IN LEINSTER HOUSE KEEP APACE OF CHANGE AND THAT THE OIREACHTAS 
IS TRULY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLEIS INTEREST. 


IN PARTICULAR, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE D‡IL AND SEANAD ARE 
RELEVANT TO EVERYDAY EVENTS. TOO OFTEN NOW, ISSUES OF TOPICAL CONCERN CAN BE 
DISCUSSED EVERYWHERE BUT IN THE HOUSES OF THE OIREACHTAS. 

FIANNA F‡IL WILL:

CHANGE PROCEDURES IN D‡IL PLENARY SESSION TO ALLOW THE RAISING OF MATTERS OF 
PUBLIC CONCERN WHEN THEY ARISE.

REVAMP TOTALLY THE SYSTEM OF PARLIAMENTARY QUESTIONS TO MAKE IT MORE OPEN AND 
INFORMATIVE. 

DISBAND THE CURRENT COMMITTEE SYSTEM AND RECONSTITUTE IT IN A MORE FOCUSED WAY. 
WE WILL SET UP FIVE COMMITTEES WHICH ARE MORE IN LINE WITH 
DEPARTMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY, IN THESE AREAS:
PUBLIC ACCOUNTS AND EXPENDITURE
SOCIAL AFFAIRS
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
LEGAL AFFAIRS

STREAMLINE VOTING PROCEDURES.

CONSIDER THE ISSUE OF FINANCIAL AUTONOMY FOR PARLIAMENT.

ENSURE THAT STATE COMPANIES, AUTHORITIES AND ALL SUCH BODIES ARE MORE 
ACCOUNTABLE TO THE OIREACHTAS.

EXTENDING THE FRANCHISE TO EMIGRANTS

FIANNA F‡IL ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING OUT THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS TO GIVE 
EMIGRANTS THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN D‡IL, PRESIDENTIAL AND EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT 
ELECTIONS, AND IN REFERENDUMS. THIS CAN BE DONE WITHOUT AMENDING THE 
CONSTITUTION.

INITIALLY, THOSE WHO HAVE LIVED ABROAD FOR UP TO 10 YEARS WILL BE ELIGIBLE. OUR 
TARGET IS TO HAVE A VOTING SYSTEM FOR EMIGRANTS IN PLACE BY THE YEAR 2000.





POLICING HIGH STANDARDS IN POLITICS

THE PUBLIC HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEMAND HIGH STANDARDS FROM POLITICIANS AND 
POLITICAL PARTIES AND IT IS THE OBLIGATION OF EVERY POLITICIAN TO RENEW FAITH IN 
OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM. 

IF WE ARE TO RENEW PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE POLITICAL AND DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM, IT 
IS IMPORTANT THAT ANY REGULATORY BODY IS FULLY INDEPENDENT AND READILY 
ACCESSIBLE TO CITIZENS. THERE MUST BE A CREDIBLE MECHANISM IN PLACE TO POLICE 
STANDARDS AND ENFORCE ACCOUNTABILITY.  THE STANDARDS SHOULD BE TOUGH AND THE 
MECHANISM SHOULD HAVE TEETH.

TO THIS END FIANNA F‡IL WILL SET UP A PERMANENT PUBLIC ETHICS COMMISSION TO 
REPLACE EXISTING STRUCTURES. THE COMMISSION WILL BE INDEPENDENTLY APPOINTED AND 
HEADED BY A HIGH-LEVEL PUBLIC OFFICIAL, WHO WILL HAVE THE STATUS OF A HIGH COURT 
JUDGE OR THE OMBUDSMAN. 

IT WILL BE CHARGED WITH THE TASK OF EXAMINING ANY ALLEGATIONS OF IMPROPRIETY OR 
ETHICAL BREACHES OR ANY REPORTS OF SUCH ALLEGATIONS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE 
COMMISSION WILL BE EMPOWERED TO RECEIVE COMPLAINTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC 
REGARDING PUBLIC OFFICE-HOLDERS.

REFORMING THE CONSTITUTION

FIANNA F‡IL WILL RECONSTITUTE THE ALL-PARTY OIREACHTAS COMMITTEE ON THE 
CONSTITUTION. CONSIDERATION WILL BE GIVEN TO PUTTING A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS TO 
THE PEOPLE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION LATER THIS YEAR. THIS 
WILL INCLUDE THE AMENDMENT ON CABINET CONFIDENTIALITY.








DELIVERING ON PRIORITIES IN HEALTHCARE

FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL

LEARN FROM THE LESSONS OF THE HEPATITIS C SCANDAL

CREATE A CUSTOMER-FOCUSED HEALTHCARE SERVICE

MAKE UP THE GROUND LOST SINCE 1994 ON HOSPITAL WAITING LISTS 

TARGET KEY HEALTHCARE AREAS FOR SPECIAL ATTENTION 

TACKLE THE CRISIS IN MENTAL HEALTH

CREATE A WOMEN-FRIENDLY HEALTH SERVICE

ADDRESS THE SPECIAL HEALTH NEEDS OF THE YOUNG, THE ELDERLY, AND OF MEN

PUT MUSCLE INTO HEALTH PROMOTION
 

AFTER THE HEPATITIS C SCANDAL 

FIANNA F‡IL RECOGNISED THE ENORMITY OF THE HEPATITIS C SCANDAL SINCE THE FIRST 
REVELATIONS, ESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO THE MCCOLE CASE. WE HAVE MADE IT A 
PRIORITY IN OPPOSITION AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IN GOVERNMENT. WE WILL LISTEN 
TO THE VICTIMS AND ACT IN CONSULTATION WITH THEM.

WE WILL IMPLEMENT IN FULL THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE JUDICIAL INQUIRY INTO 
HEPATITIS C. WE WILL ENSURE THAT COMPENSATION FOR THE VICTIMS OF THIS SCANDAL IS 
FAIR AND THAT COMPREHENSIVE COUNSELLING AND CARE ARE AVAILABLE.

WE WILL PROVIDE FOR THE INQUIRY INTO THE HEPATITIS C INFECTION OF HAEMOPHILIACS 
AND THE INQUIRY INTO THE HIV CONTAMINATION OF BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS. WE WILL 
PUBLISH ALL CORRESPONDENCE AND DOCUMENTS AND INVESTIGATE HOW THE LEGAL STRATEGY 
IN THE MCCOLE CASE WAS DEVELOPED.



WE WILL MAINTAIN THE COMPENSATION TRIBUNAL ON A STATUTORY BASIS AND PROVIDE 
ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL SO VICTIMSI CASES CAN BE HEARD FASTER. GIVEN THE DIFFICULTY 
SOME VICTIMS HAVE WITH LIFE INSURANCE AND MORTGAGE INSURANCE, THE STATE WILL 
CONSIDER PROVIDING UNDERWRITING SERVICES. HEALTHCARE FOR VICTIMS WILL BE 
DEVELOPED AND INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH INTO HEPATITIS C WILL BE ACCELERATED. AN 
EPIDEMOLOGICAL STUDY INTO HEPATITIS C WILL BE INITIATED.

ALL VICTIMS, INCLUDING ANTI-D MOTHERS, HAEMOPHILIACS, TRANSFUSION PATIENTS AND 
RENAL PATIENTS, WILL RECEIVE FAIR TREATMENT FROM THE STATE.

A CUSTOMER-FOCUSED HEALTHCARE SERVICE

GIVEN WHAT HAS BEEN REVEALED ABOUT THE HEALTH SERVICE IN THE HEPATITIS C AFFAIR-  
PEOPLE HAD DIFFICULTY GETTING BASIC INFORMATION, AND A CULTURE OF SECRECY 
APPLIED IN MANY AREAS OF THE STATE APPARATUS - WE BELIEVE THERE IS A CLEAR-CUT 
NEED TO INTRODUCE NEW SYSTEMS TO MAKE THE HEALTH SERVICE MORE OPEN AND MORE 
CONSUMER-ORIENTED. THIS PRO-CONSUMER TREND IN THE HEALTH SERVICE HAS ALREADY 
HAPPENED IN EUROPE, BUT IRELAND HAS LAGGED BEHIND. FIANNA F‡IL WILL ADDRESS THIS 
WITH THE FOLLOWING INITIATIVES:

COMPLAINTS. WE WILL REQUIRE HEALTH BOARDS TO INTRODUCE PROPER SYSTEMS FOR 
RECORDING AND RESPONDING TO PATIENTSI COMPLAINTS. 

THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH WILL PUBLISH A STATISTICAL REPORT ON THE LEVEL OF 
COMPLAINTS ON A HOSPITAL BY HOSPITAL BASIS. WE WILL ENSURE PROMPT ACTION BY 
HOSPITALS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF JUSTIFIED COMPLAINTS.

OMBUDSMAN. WE BELIEVE PEOPLE NOW WANT AN IDENTIFIABLE OFFICE ESTABLISHED WHERE 
THEY CAN TAKE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE MEDICAL TREATMENT THEY OR THEIR FAMILY HAVE 
RECEIVED. AT PRESENT, THE OMBUDSMAN CAN DEAL ONLY WITH ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS 
RELATING TO HEALTH BOARDS. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN OMBUDSMAN FOR 
MEDICAL MATTERS TO INVESTIGATE LEGITIMATE MEDICAL COMPLAINTS. WE WILL CONSULT 
WITH ALL RELEVANT INTEREST GROUPS ON THIS PROPOSAL.

WATCHING OVER STANDARDS. WE WILL CREATE A SYSTEM OF AUDITS OF HEALTH SERVICE 
STANDARDS TO ENSURE THERE CAN BE NO REPEAT OF THE HEPATITIS C SCANDAL, WHEN A 
STATE AGENCY BREACHED ITS OWN GUIDELINES WITHOUT DETECTION. WE WILL REQUIRE ALL 
HEALTH AGENCIES AND HOSPITALS TO SECURE THE QUALITY ASSURANCE MARK. WE WILL ALSO 
DO CLINICAL AUDITS, TO PROVIDE A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE WAY HEALTHCARE IS 
DELIVERED.

HEALTH INSURANCE. WE WILL ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT VHI USERSI GROUP TO GIVE THE 
CONSUMER A GREATER INPUT. WE WILL PRODUCE A WHITE PAPER ON HEALTH INSURANCE TO 
LOOK AT THE OPTIONS FOR THE STATE, ESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO THE VHIIS FUTURE 
AND THE POTENTIAL OF A STRATEGIC ALLIANCE. 
WE WILL ALSO ORDER A REVISION OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE REGULATIONS, TO IMPROVE 
OUT-PATIENT COVER.  THE PRESENT REGULATIONS REQUIRE THE SPENDING OF LARGE SUMS 
BEFORE ANY BENEFIT CAN BE CLAIMED UNDER HEALTH INSURANCE. FIANNA F‡IL OPPOSED 
THE CHANGES WHICH LED TO COVER FOR PSYCHIATRIC IN-PATIENT TREATMENT BEING 
REDUCED FROM 180 DAYS TO 100. THIS CHANGE HAD MAJOR IMPLICATIONS IN RELATION TO 
ANOREXIA, BULIMIA AND OTHER DISORDERS. IN GOVERNMENT, WE WILL AIM TO REDRAW 
THESE REGULATIONS SO AS TO EASE THE SITUATION OF PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES.

GENERAL PRACTITIONERS.  WE WILL AIM TO HAVE ALL GMS PRACTICES COMPUTERISED, TO 
ENHANCE PATIENT CARE AND REDUCE THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON DOCTORS. WE WILL 
UPDATE THE MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS ACT, TO REFLECT THE VAST CHANGES IN THE MEDICAL 
RŽGIME OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS. 

MODERNISING OUR HOSPITALS AND UPGRADING THEIR SERVICES

AS WE HAVE DONE BEFORE IN GOVERNMENT, FIANNA F‡IL WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND 
MODERNISE OUR HOSPITALS, TO PROVIDE THE BEST IN MODERN CARE. 

WE WILL STREAMLINE ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY SERVICES, ESPECIALLY IN DUBLIN WHERE A 
MAJOR CRISIS DEVELOPS EVERY WINTER. WE WILL ADDRESS THIS WITH:

TIGHTER CONTROLS ON ADMISSIONS AND DISCHARGE POLICIES IN MAJOR HOSPITALS;

MORE RIGID ADHERENCE BY CONSULTANTS TO PRACTICE PLANS, WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN 
AGREED WITH ALL AREAS OF MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING NURSES;

NURSING UNITS ORGANISED AND RUN BY NURSES FOR PATIENTS WHO REQUIRE MINIMUM 
MEDICAL INPUT BUT HIGH LEVELS OF NURSING CARE;

A REVIEW OF THE EMERGENCY AMBULANCE SERVICE;

A REVIEW OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY GPS, WITH A VIEW TO EXPANDING THEM;

GP UNITS IN ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS, ALONG THE LINES OF THE SCHEME 
RUN IN CORK.

WE WILL TACKLE HOSPITAL WAITING LISTS AS A PRIORITY. THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT HAVE 
PLACED A LACK OF EMPHASIS ON THE HOSPITAL WAITING LIST INITIATIVE. WAITING LISTS 
INCREASED BY ONE-THIRD AT ONE STAGE DURING 1996.



OUR AIM WILL BE TO ELIMINATE WAITING LISTS OF OVER 12 MONTHS IN ORTHOPAEDIC 
SURGERY(ESPECIALLY HIP REPLACEMENTS), OPHTHALMOLOGY, EAR, NOSE AND THROAT, 
CARDIAC SURGERY, VASCULAR SURGERY AND PLASTIC SURGERY. WE WILL SET A MAXIMUM 
PERIOD OF 6 MONTHS FOR CHILDREN AWAITING ENT OR EYE TREATMENT. WE WILL ENSURE 
THAT QUIET HOSPITAL PERIODS SUCH AS THE SUMMER MONTHS ARE USED TO MAKE INROADS 
INTO THE LISTS.

WARD CLOSURES AND THE CLOSING OF BEDS BY THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT HAVE CONTRIBUTED 
TO THE ESCALATION IN THE LISTS. WE WILL UNDERTAKE RESEARCH INTO THE UNDERLYING 
CAUSES OF DELAYS AND THE VARIATION IN THESE AROUND THE COUNTRY.

TARGETING KEY HEALTHCARE AREAS FOR SPECIAL ATTENTION

DRUGS. WE WILL IMPLEMENT OUR INTEGRATED DRUGS STRATEGY, BRINGING TOGETHER THE 
INTERVENTIONS OF SEVERAL GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.

CANCER. OUR RATE OF DEATHS DUE TO CANCER IS HIGHER THAN THE EU AVERAGE, AT 
AROUND 7,500 A YEAR. AFTER HEART DISEASE, CANCER IS THE COUNTRYIS BIGGEST KILLER 
AMONG UNDER 65S. 18,000 NEW CASES ARE RECORDED ANNUALLY; IN 1996, CANCER 
ACCOUNTED FOR 50,000 HOSPITAL EPISODES.

CANCER DEATHS AMONG IRISH WOMEN ARE PARTICULARLY HIGH AND ACTION NEEDS TO BE 
TAKEN. SCREENING CAN PLAY A MAJOR PART IN DETECTION AND WILL BE DEVELOPED. 
FIANNA F‡IL ARE COMMITTED TO THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATIONAL CANCER 
STRATEGY, INCLUDING THE SETTING UP OF CENTRES OF EXCELLENCE IN DUBLIN, CORK AND 
GALWAY AND EIGHT REGIONAL CENTRES.

HOSPICES. A NATIONAL HOSPICE PLAN WILL BE DEVELOPED, AND A HOME CARE SERVICE FOR 
THE TERMINALLY ILL WILL BE DEVELOPED IN CO-OPERATION WITH GPS. WE WILL SET UP A 
NATIONAL ADVISORY COUNCIL FOR HOSPICE AND SPECIALIST PALLIATIVE CARE SERVICES TO 
ADVISE THE MINISTER ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATIONAL PLAN, AND ON WAYS TO 
ENCOURAGE GREATER PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN STATUTORY AND VOLUNTARY BODIES IN 
PROVIDING HOSPICE AND SPECIALIST  PALLIATIVE CARE SERVICES.

WE WILL REQUIRE EACH HEALTH BOARD OR AUTHORITY TO SET UP A REGIONAL HOSPICE AND 
SPECIALIST PALLIATIVE CARE COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 
NATIONAL COUNCIL.
 
THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF TRAINING AND EDUCATION IN PALLIATIVE CARE WILL BE 
ADDRESSED IN ALL SERVICE DEVELOPMENT PLANS.

SIGHT TESTING. WE WILL EXTEND NATIONWIDE ADULT SIGHT TESTING FOR MEDICAL CARD 
HOLDERS, USING THE METHODS ALREADY IN USE BY THE EASTERN HEALTH BOARD.

MENINGITIS. THERE HAS BEEN A RAPID INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF MENINGITIS CASES 
THIS YEAR. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CALLS FOR A NATIONAL SURVEILLANCE CENTRE TO 
MONITOR MENINGITIS, BUT THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH HAS POSTPONED ITS SETTING UP 
UNTIL 1998. FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL IMMEDIATELY SET UP THE CENTRE.

DENTAL SERVICES. WE WILL WORK TO MAKE DENTAL SERVICES MORE EFFICIENT AND WE WILL 
UNDERTAKE A REVIEW TO DETERMINE HOW BEST THE SERVICES CAN BE IMPROVED.

MEDICAL CARDS. FIANNA F‡IL WILL REVIEW THE GUIDELINES ISSUED BY HEALTH BOARDS 
FOR ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAL CARDS. AS IS NOTED IN THE REPORT ON THE INTEGRATION 
OF THE TAX AND WELFARE SYSTEMS, THE GUIDELINES CAN PRODUCE DISINCENTIVES TO 
WORK. IN THE REVIEW OF THE GUIDELINES, FIANNA F‡IL WILL RECOGNISE THERE ARE 
PARTICULAR HARDSHIPS FOR LOW-INCOME WORKING FAMILIES. 

ADDRESSING THEIR DIFFICULTIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH YOUNG CHILDREN, WILL BE A 
PRIORITY FOR FIANNA F‡IL. WE WILL ALSO ASSIST THE ELDERLY, AND WE WILL CONSIDER 
DOUBLING THE INCOME ELIGIBILITY LIMITS FOR MEDICAL CARDS FOR THOSE OVER 65.

TACKLING THE CRISIS IN MENTAL HEALTH

FIANNA F‡IL RECOGNISE THERE IS A CRISIS IN MENTAL HANDICAP AND MENTAL HEALTH 
SERVICES. WE WILL MAKE MENTAL HANDICAP A PRIORITY AREA. IT IS OUR INTENTION TO 
TACKLE THE CRISIS. 

THERE ARE ALMOST 2,400 PEOPLE WITH A MENTAL HANDICAP ON WAITING LISTS FOR 
RESIDENTIAL AND DAY CARE PLACES. THERE ARE 1,000 PEOPLE WITH A MENTAL HANDICAP 
RESIDING IN APPALLING CONDITIONS IN PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS.

IN 1996, 66 NEW RESIDENTIAL PLACES WERE CREATED WHEN 1,450 WERE NEEDED. AND 
THOSE FAMILIES WHO HAVE A SERVICE HAVE NO GUARANTEE THAT IT WILL BE PERMANENT - 
THEIR SERVICE CAN BE DISCONTINUED AT ANY STAGE.

IT WILL BE OUR INTENTION TO SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE SERVICES OVER THE LIFETIME OF 
THE GOVERNMENT. WE ARE FIRMLY COMMITTED TO TACKLING THE SITUATION IN RELATION TO 
INAPPROPRIATE PLACEMENTS, THE WAITING LISTS FOR RESIDENTIAL AND DAY CARE AND 
INADEQUATE RESPITE FACILITIES. 

IN GOVERNMENT, WE WILL QUICKLY PUBLISH A NATIONAL 5-YEAR PLAN FOR THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WE WILL INTRODUCE EARLY INTERVENTION 
GROUPS AT REGIONAL LEVEL TO ASSIST THE PARENTS AND MEDICAL STAFF ASSOCIATED WITH 
PEOPLE WHO ARE MENTALLY HANDICAPPED. WE WILL REPLACE THE CURRENT HAPHAZARD 
APPROACH TO FUNDING THE CARE AND EDUCATION OF THE MENTALLY HANDICAPPED. WE 
ACCEPT THAT THE NATIONAL DATABASE NEEDS RESOURCES.
THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT HAVE ABYSMALLY FAILED IN THE AREA OF MENTAL HEALTH. 
DESPITE A PROMISE IN ITS PROGRAMME FOR GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THE 
IMPROVEMENTS MADE UP TO 1994, THE SITUATION HAS NOT IMPROVED.  THE MINISTER HAS 
EVEN REFUSED TO PUBLISH THE 5-YEAR PLAN WHICH HE  PROMISED. 

THIS HAS NOT STOPPED THE GOVERNMENT FROM MAKING MORE PROMISES. IN PARTNERSHIP 
2000, A COMMITMENT IS GIVEN TO DEVELOP SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HANDICAP. 
THE T‡NAISTE IN HIS SPEECH TO THE LABOUR PARTY CONFERENCE THIS YEAR SAID: ÒTHE 
MOTHER WHOSE CHILD IS DIAGNOSED WITH A PERMANENT DISABILITY SHOULD BE GUARANTEED  
- AND I MEAN GUARANTEED - THAT FROM THAT MOMENT ON, A RANGE OF SERVICES IS 
AVAILABLE TO HER AND TO HER CHILD.  COUNSELLING, EDUCATION, TRAINING, PERSONAL 
ASSISTANCE, EMPLOYMENT, RESIDENTIAL AND RESPITE CARE  MOTHERS WHO CARRY THE 
BURDEN OF DISABILITY, AND THE PEOPLE WHO CONSTANTLY HAVE TO BREAK DOWN BARRIERS 
TO OVERCOME DISABILITIES  SHOULD BOTH ENJOY SUCH A SOCIAL GUARANTEE.Ó  

THESE WORDS ARE FROM THE LEADER OF THE PARTY TO WHICH THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION 
BELONGS, AND SHE IS THE PERSON WHO APPEALED THE JUDGEMENT IN THE HIGH COURT 
WHICH HELD THAT PAUL OIDONOGHUE HAD BEEN DENIED HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO FREE 
PRIMARY EDUCATION. IT IS ALSO FROM A MAN WHO WAS ONE OF THE THREE LEADERS OF A 
GOVERNMENT THAT HAS NEVER BEFORE TREATED THE MENTAL HANDICAP SECTOR WITH SUCH 
DISDAIN.

IN THE 36-YEAR-OLD HISTORY OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE MENTALLY 
HANDICAPPED OF IRELAND, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A SITUATION WHERE A MINISTER FOR 
HEALTH REFUSED TO MEET THEM DURING HIS OR HER TERM OF OFFICE. HOWEVER, THE 
CURRENT MINISTER FOR HEALTH NEVER ONCE MET WITH NAMHI, AND IT WAS NOT FROM A 
WANT OF TRYING ON THEIR PART.

ADDRESSING THE HEALTHCARE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND THE ELDERLY 

FIANNA F‡IL WILL INTRODUCE MANDATORY REPORTING BY PROFESSIONALS OF KNOWN / 
SUSPECTED CASES OF CHILD ABUSE. WE WILL GIVE FORMAL AND LEGAL EFFECT TO 
NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES PRESENTLY BEING PUT IN PLACE ON FOOT OF THE KILKENNY AND 
OTHER REPORTS. WE WILL ENGAGE IN NORMAL CONSULTATIONS WITH INTERESTED PARTIES IN 
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS POLICY.  WE WILL EXTEND CHILDCARE SERVICES THROUGH 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL CHILDCARE STRATEGY. THIS WILL EXAMINE THE SETTING 
UP OF A NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR CHILDREN, TO PROVIDE A RANGE OF RESEARCH, TRAINING 
AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES IN THE FIELD OF CHILDCARE.

WE WILL MAKE IT A PRIORITY TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT SPREAD OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
CHILDCARE MATTERS BETWEEN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS. AS A RESULT, SOME CHILDREN DO 
NOT RECEIVE ADEQUATE CARE. THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE KILKENNY INCEST REPORT, 
ADDED TO BY THE KELLY FITZGERALD REPORT AND THE MADONNA HOUSE REPORT, FORM A 
BLUEPRINT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF APPROPRIATE RESPONSES ON CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION 
AND CHILD PROTECTION.
WE WILL DEVELOP THE ROLE OF THE OMBUDSMAN FOR CHILDREN. A MAJOR PRIORITY FOR THE 
PLAN WILL BE TO ADDRESS THE OUT-OF-HOURS CHILD PROTECTION SERVICE, WHICH IS 
CURRENTLY POOR. EACH OF THE EIGHT REGIONAL HEALTH BOARDS WILL BE OBLIGED TO 
DEVELOP A CENTRALISED CHILD ABUSE REGISTER. 

THIS WILL ISOLATE CHILDREN WHO ARE SEEN TO BE AT RISK AND CLARIFY THE FORMAL 
STATUS OF THEIR CASE. IT WILL ALSO FACILITATE CO-OPERATION BETWEEN 
JURISDICTIONS.

HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY. FIANNA F‡IL WILL PUT IN PLACE A HEALTH SERVICE 
PLANNING PROGRAMME TO TACKLE THE CHALLENGE POSED BY THE GREYING POPULATION. THE 
NUMBER OF PERSONS AGED OVER 65 IS EXPECTED TO GROW OVER THE NEXT 30 YEARS BY UP 
TO 40%, WHILE THE NUMBER OVER 85 WILL ALSO GROW EVEN MORE SUBSTANTIALLY.

WE WILL CONSIDER INITIATIVES IN DEVELOPING COMMUNITY CARE, IN THE PROVISION OF 
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE NURSING HOMES, IN THE AVAILABILITY OF LONG-STAY NURSING CARE 
AND FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND REMUNERATION OF HOME-HELP SERVICES. WE BELIEVE THE 
PAYMENTS FOR HOME HELP FOR THE ELDERLY AND THE SICK MUST BE ADDRESSED AS A 
PRIORITY, PARTICULARLY WHERE HIGH LEVELS OF DEPENDENCY APPLY.  WE WILL SEEK TO 
ADDRESS THE HOME HELP SCHEME TO ENSURE THE SITUATION OF CARERS IS IMPROVED.

CREATING A WOMEN-FRIENDLY HEALTH SERVICE

AT PRESENT, THE AREA OF WOMENIS HEALTHCARE IS FRAUGHT WITH SERVICE GAPS. THE 
LIFE EXPECTANCY OF IRISH WOMEN IS ONE OF THE LOWEST IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND 
IS FULLY TWO YEARS LESS THAN THE EUROPEAN AVERAGE. 

FIANNA F‡IL WILL UNDERTAKE A MAJOR PROGRAMME OF ACTION ON WOMENIS HEALTH. OUR 
AIM WILL BE TO CREATE A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT IS WOMEN-FRIENDLY, AND WHICH 
OPERATES ON THE PRINCIPLES OF RESPECT, CONSULTATION, INVOLVEMENT, EMPOWERMENT 
AND CHOICE. WE WILL ENGAGE IN ONGOING CONSULTATION WITH WOMEN IN ALL SECTORS OF 
SOCIETY. 

WE WILL UNDERTAKE A PROGRAMME OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION AND INTERVENTION 
PROGRAMMES IN RELATION TO SMOKING AND ALCOHOL MISUSE BY WOMEN IN GENERAL AND 
PREGNANT WOMEN IN PARTICULAR. THIS WILL INCLUDE AN EDUCATION PROGRAMME FOR 
SECOND-LEVEL SCHOOLS.

WE WILL USE ALL POSSIBLE CHANNELS TO DISSEMINATE INFORMATION ON WHEN WOMEN 
SHOULD HAVE CERVICAL SMEAR TESTS AND HOW TO CONDUCT BREAST SELF-EXAMINATION. WE 
WILL IMPLEMENT AS A MATTER OF URGENCY THE RECOMMENDATION BY THE REPORT OF THE 
COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN THAT CERVICAL SMEAR TESTS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE 
ON THE GMS SCHEME FOR SCREENING AS WELL AS DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSES. THERE WILL ALSO 
BE STRATEGIES TO INFORM WOMEN ABOUT THE HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF THE MENOPAUSE AND 
OSTEOPOROSIS.

WE WILL MAKE FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES AVAIL-ABLE TO ALL WHO NEED THEM, 
IRRESPECTIVE OF WHERE THEY LIVE OR THEIR FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES.

WE WILL MAKE PARENTING SKILLS PART OF ANTE-NATAL AND POST-NATAL EDUCATION, WHICH 
PARTNERS WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO ATTEND. SINGLE WOMEN IN PARTICULAR WILL BE GIVEN 
BETTER PREPARATION TO CARE FOR THEIR BABIES.

WE WILL CONTINUE STUDIES INTO THE CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING TO CRISIS PREGNANCIES 
AND TO ABORTIONS AND TO INVESTIGATE HOW NUMBERS CAN BE REDUCED. WE WILL PROVIDE 
COMPREHENSIVE COUNSELLING AND HEALTHCARE FOR WOMEN IN CRISIS 
PREGNANCIES.

FIANNA F‡IL HAVE ESTABLISHED AN EXPERT GROUP TO REPORT ON ALL ASPECTS, 
INCLUDING LEGISLATIVE AND CONSTITUTIONAL ONES, IN RELATION TO ABORTION. WHEN 
THIS GROUP HAS REPORTED, WE WILL TAKE THE NECESSARY ACTION, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT 
THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE ALL-PARTY COMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITUTION.

ACKNOWLEDGING THE PROBLEMS OF MENIS HEALTH
 
UP TO NOW, HEALTH MATTERS HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH AN OUT-OF-BOUNDS ONE FOR MEN. 
THERE IS THE PERCEPTION THAT HEALTH MATTERS ARE NOT MENIS SCENE. HOWEVER, CANCER 
AND OTHER HEALTH MATTERS ARE ALSO MAJOR CONCERNS FOR MEN.

MEN DIE SIX YEARS YOUNGER THAN WOMEN. DISEASES LIKE CORONARY HEART DISEASE KILL 
AT LEAST ONE IN EVERY THREE MEN. HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AFFECTS ONE IN FIVE. ONE IN 
THREE GETS CANCER, WHILE ONE IN FOUR DIES FROM IT. PROSTATE CANCER IN MEN IS 
ALMOST AS COMMON AS BREAST CANCER IN WOMEN: ONE IN EVERY 32 MALES DEVELOPS 
PROSTATE CANCER. FIVE TIMES AS MANY MEN DIE FROM CANCER OF THE PROSTATE AS THE 
NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO DIES FROM CERVICAL CANCER. PROSTATIC CANCER IS NOT AS WELL 
RESEARCHED AS ANY OF THE FEMALE CANCERS.

TESTICULAR CANCER IS THE COMMONEST FORM OF CANCER IN MEN AGED 15-44. ONE IN 
EVERY 251 MEN WILL DEVELOP CANCER OF THE TESTES. 

WOMEN HAVE USED THE HEALTH SERVICE MORE INTELLIGENTLY AND MORE FREQUENTLY THAN 
MEN. IT IS TIME FOR MEN TO LEARN FROM WOMEN AND THE WAY THEY HAVE RAISED 
CONSCIOUSNESS OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS ABOUT THEIR GENDER-SPECIFIC CANCERS. FIANNA 
F‡ILIS HEALTH PROMOTION PROGRAMME WILL ADDRESS THIS.






PUTTING GREATER MUSCLE INTO HEALTH PROMOTION
 
PROPERLY-RESOURCED HEALTH PROMOTION WILL BE A PRIORITY OF FIANNA F‡IL IN 
GOVERNMENT.  WE SEE HEALTH PROMOTION AS A HIGHLY COST-EFFECTIVE 
INVESTMENT.

SUICIDE. SUICIDE IS A GROWING PROBLEM IN IRELAND, ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE. 
AS FEW AS ONE IN FIVE YOUNG SUICIDES GIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT A CHANCE 
BEFORE GOING TO THEIR DEATHS. 

FIANNA F‡IL AIM TO CHANGE THIS THROUGH BETTER AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION, AND 
BETTER TREATMENT OF THOSE AT RISK THROUGH ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE, DRUG ABUSE OR 
DEPRESSION. 

WE WILL BRING IN PRIORITY MEASURES TO RESEARCH SUICIDE. BETTER USE WILL BE MADE 
OF THE CORONERIS ENQUIRY BY EXTENDING THE CONFIDENTIAL REPORT SENT BY THE GARDA' 
TO THE CENTRAL STATISTICS OFFICE. WE WILL CONSULT WITH A VIEW TO DEVELOPING 
MEDIA GUIDELINES FOR REPORTING SUICIDES. 

ALCOHOL PROBLEMS. WE WILL CONTROL THE ADVERTISING, PACKAGING AND PROMOTION OF 
ALCOHOLIC LEMONADES, AND CONSIDER IMPOSING HIGHER EXCISE DUTIES ON THESE 
PRODUCTS. 

WE WILL DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE JOINT APPROACH BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE 
SECTORS TO ENCOURAGE MODERATE USE OF ALCOHOL. WE WILL GIVE PARTICULAR ATTENTION 
TO ADVERTISING AIMED AT YOUNG PEOPLE.  

OVERALL, FIANNA F‡IL WILL ENERGETICALLY IMPLEMENT THE NATIONAL ALCOHOL POLICY IN 
FULL, INCLUDING THE SETTING UP OF A NATIONAL ALCOHOL COUNCIL.

AIDS.  WE WILL ENSURE THAT ALL SEXUALLY-ACTIVE MEN AND WOMEN ARE INFORMED OF THE 
RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH AIDS AND HOW THESE RISKS CAN BE MINIMISED.
 
ASTHMA. ASTHMA IS BECOMING THE DISEASE OF THE DECADE. WE WILL INTRODUCE A HIGH 
PROFILE TREATMENT AND AWARENESS PROGRAMME, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WOULD 
BENEFIT FROM EARLY TREATMENT.   











SUPPORTING THE FAMILY AND THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN 

FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL

SET UP A COMMISSION FOR PARENTS IN THE HOME

IMPLEMENT A STRATEGY DESIGNED TO RECONCILE WORK AND FAMILY LIFE

ADDRESS THE EFFECTS OF DIVORCE BY APPOINTING A COMMISSIONER FOR CHILDREN AND 
STRENGTHENING COUNSELLING AND MEDIATION SERVICES 

FACILITATE ADULT ADOPTED CHILDREN AND THEIR BIRTH PARENTS WHO WISH TO MAKE 
CONTACT, AND FULLY RECOGNISE FOREIGN ADOPTIONS UNDER IRISH LAW

PROMOTE THE STATUS OF WOMEN AT WORK AND IN BUSINESS 

WORK TO ELIMINATE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN

CREATE A FAIRER DEAL FOR CHARITABLE LOTTERIES


 
PARENTS IN THE HOME

THERE ARE 500,000 IRISH WOMEN AND A MUCH SMALLER NUMBER OF MALE PARENTS  WORKING 
FULL-TIME IN THE HOME. IT IS A PRIORITY OF FIANNA F‡IL TO PROVIDE THEM WITH 
SUPPORT TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE HOME AND COMMUNITY. FIANNA F‡IL 
WILL ESTABLISH A COMMISSION FOR PARENTS IN THE HOME TO RECOMMEND A STRATEGY FOR 
THE NEXT MILLENNIUM. 

SOCIAL ISOLATION IS A MAJOR CONCERN. WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
COMMUNITY-BASED GROUPS AND PROJECTS WHICH HELP IMPROVE THE POSITION OF PARENTS 
AT HOME.

WORK AND FAMILY LIFE

FIANNA F‡IL ARE COMMITTED TO AN OVERALL POLICY DESIGNED TO RECONCILE WORK AND 
FAMILY LIFE. WE WILL ENCOURAGE JOB SHARING, FLEXI-TIME AND FLEXI-PLACE WORKING 
ARRANGEMENTS AS WAYS OF FACILITATING WOMEN WHO WISH TO PARTICIPATE IN THE 
WORKPLACE AND MAINTAIN A FAMILY/HOME LIFE. 
THERE IS A CLEAR NEED FOR A CO-ORDINATED PROGRAMME TO PROVIDE PROPERLY QUALIFIED 
CHILD-CARERS AND TO MAXIMISE THE USE OF COMMUNITY FACILITIES FOR CRCHE AND 
CHILDCARE FACILITIES. 

THERE IS A NEED TO DEVELOP PROGRAMMES OF AFTER-SCHOOL CARE AND PLAY SCHEMES FOR 
HOLIDAY PERIODS. FIANNA F‡IL WILL ENCOURAGE INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE THESE 
PROGRAMMES AND WILL MAKE ARRANGEMENTS TO ENSURE THAT INSURANCE CAN EASILY BE PUT 
IN PLACE. 

FIANNA F‡IL WILL INTRODUCE PATERNITY LEAVE, FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH THE 
SOCIAL PARTNERS. A CHILDCARE POLICY UNIT WILL BE ESTABLISHED IN THE DEPARTMENT 
OF HEALTH. FIANNA F‡ILIS TAX POLICY WILL MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO THE COST OF 
CHILDCARE.
  
ADDRESSING THE EFFECTS OF DIVORCE

A COMMISSIONER FOR CHILDREN.  IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 10,000 TO 15,000 COUPLES WILL 
APPLY FOR DIVORCE IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS. TO ENSURE ADEQUATE PROTECTION FOR 
CHILDREN, WE WILL APPOINT A COMMISSIONER FOR  CHILDREN, INITIALLY ATTACHED TO 
THE COURTS, WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIGHLIGHTING TO PARENTS THE NEEDS OF 
CHILDREN IN MARRIAGE BREAKDOWN/DIVORCE AND FOR PRESSING THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN IN 
COURT WHERE NECESSARY. 

COUNSELLING.  THE INITIAL IMPACT OF DIVORCE MAY PLACE A GREAT BURDEN ON THE 
AVAILABLE COUNSELLING SERVICE. FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL ENSURE THAT 
SUFFICIENT RESOURCES ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE EXISTING MARRIAGE COUNSELLING 
SERVICES TO ENABLE THEM TO MEET THE NEED FOR COUNSELLING THAT WILL ARISE IN THE 
NEXT FEW YEARS. WE WILL ALSO PLAN FOR THE LONG-TERM FUTURE BY CREATING A 
PERMANENT COUNSELLING SERVICE SUPPORTED BY THE STATE, TO COMPLEMENT OR AUGMENT 
THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE CHURCHES. 

MEDIATION. IN EACH DIVORCE CASE THE JUDGE HAS TO BE SATISFIED THAT ADEQUATE 
PROVISION IS MADE FOR DEPENDANTS. OBVIOUSLY, IF IN ADVANCE OF THE COURT 
APPEARANCE THE PARTIES HAVE WORKED OUT AN AGREEMENT ON THE FINANCIAL MATTERS, 
EITHER BY THEMSELVES OR WITH THE AID OF A MEDIATOR, THIS WOULD SAVE COURT TIME 
AND CUT COURT COSTS.  A MEDIATION SERVICE IS NOW AVAILABLE ONLY IN DUBLIN AND 
LIMERICK. FIANNA F‡IL ON RETURN TO GOVERNMENT WILL BEGIN IMMEDIATELY TO SET UP 
THIS SERVICE NATIONWIDE. WE WILL LOOK CAREFULLY AT DOING THIS IN CONJUNCTION 
WITH THE LEGAL AID SERVICE AS A ONE STOP OPERATION.

BRINGING OUR ADOPTION LEGISLATION UP TO DATE

MANY ADOPTED CHILDREN WISH ON REACHING ADULTHOOD TO ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH THEIR 
BIRTH PARENTS, BUT THIS HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE UNDER OUR CLOSED ADOPTION SYSTEM. 
FIANNA F‡IL HAVE PRESENTED A BILL WHICH ESTABLISHES A VOLUNTARY CONTACT 
REGISTER, AND ON RETURN TO GOVERNMENT WILL IMMEDIATELY ENACT THIS BILL. A 
REGISTER OF THIS KIND WILL ENABLE A GREAT MANY ADOPTED CHILDREN AND BIRTH 
PARENTS TO ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER,  IF BOTH PARTIES ARE IN AGREEMENT, 
AND IS AN ESSENTIAL FIRST STEP IN MAKING PROGRESS IN THIS AREA.

WHEN IRISH COUPLES SEEK TO ADOPT ABROAD, THEY VERY OFTEN ARE OFFERED CHILDREN 
ONLY ON A BASIS THAT IS NOT YET RECOGNISED IN IRISH LAW, ONE THAT TRANSFERS 
PARENTAL RIGHTS AND AUTHORITY TO THE ADOPTERS BUT DOES NOT SEVER LEGAL TIES 
BETWEEN THE ADOPTED CHILD AND THE BIRTH PARENTS. THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT HAVE 
REFUSED TO EXTEND RECOGNITION IN IRISH LAW TO THESE ADOPTIONS. THE RESULT IS 
THAT, FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES, OPPORTUNITIES FOR IRISH COUPLES TO ADOPT ABROAD 
HAVE BEEN HUGELY CURTAILED.AS IT IS LIKELY IN THE FUTURE THAT THE NUMBERS OF 
BABIES AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION HERE WILL FALL WELL SHORT OF MEETING THE NEEDS OF 
THE MANY COUPLES WHO WISH TO ADOPT, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE ROAD BLOCK WHICH 
THE GOVERNMENT HAVE UNNECESSARILY PLACED IN THE WAY OF THESE COUPLES IS REMOVED. 
FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL LEGISLATE TO EXTEND RECOGNITION IN IRISH LAW TO 
ADOPTIONS EFFECTED ABROAD.

WOMEN AT WORK AND IN BUSINESS
 
FIANNA F‡IL WILL PROGRESS STEPS TO ELIMINATE DISCRIMINATORY AND PREJUDICIAL 
PRACTICES IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE. 

WE WILL AMEND THE ANTI-DISCRIMINATION (PAY) LEGISLATION TO ALLOW THE USE OF 
NOTIONAL COMPARATORS. THIS WILL MEAN THAT WORKERS IN OCCUPATIONS WHICH ARE 
OVERWHELMINGLY FEMALE WILL BE ABLE TO BASE EQUAL PAY CLAIMS ON THE EARNINGS OF 
OTHER GROUPS OF SIMILARLY QUALIFIED WORKERS DOING SIMILAR JOBS.

WE SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF THE EXISTING JOINT LABOUR COMMITTEES TO TACKLE 
EFFECTIVELY THE PROBLEM OF LOW PAY AS WELL AS A NATIONAL MINIMUM HOURLY WAGE. 

FIANNA FAIL RECOGNISED THE TREND TOWARDS PART-TIME WORK AND EXPANDED THE SOCIAL 
INSURANCE SYSTEM TO PROVIDE COVER FOR PART-TIME WORKERS. SOME 70% OF ALL PART-
TIME WORKERS ARE FEMALE, MANY OF WHOM WILL RETIRE ON A SOCIAL WELFARE PENSION. 
HOWEVER, THE PROVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL PENSIONS IS AN OUTSTANDING ISSUE AND 
FIANNA F‡IL WILL SEEK TO REMOVE THIS DISCRIMINATION ON OUR RETURN TO GOVERNMENT. 

A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF TRAINING, EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT 
OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO WOMEN IN THE HOME WHO WISH TO RETURN TO 
THE WORKFORCE. 

SEXUAL HARASSMENT UNDERMINES AN INDIVIDUALIS DIGNITY BY BRINGING AN UNWANTED AND 
UNWELCOME CONNOTATION TO WORKING RELATIONSHIPS. AT PRESENT, THERE ARE NO 
LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS DEALING WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT, ALTHOUGH THE CURRENT 
EMPLOYMENT EQUALITY BILL ENDEAVOURS TO ADDRESS IT. FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE THAT 
SEPARATE FOCUSED LEGISLATION IS REQUIRED. 

WOMEN ARE POORLY REPRESENTED AT SENIOR LEVELS OF RESPONSIBILITY IN SOCIAL 
PARTNER ORGANISATIONS AND ARE GROSSLY UNDER-REPRESENTED ON NEGOTIATING TEAMS AND 
ON THE CENTRAL REVIEW COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL AGREEMENT. WE WILL ENSURE THAT 
WOMEN ARE REPRESENTED EQUITABLY ON THESE NEGOTIATING BODIES. IT IS ALSO 
IMPORTANT THAT WE REFLECT THE VIEWS OF PARENTS WORKING IN THE HOME IN OUR SOCIAL 
AND ECONOMIC PLANNING. FIANNA F‡IL STRONGLY SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF QUOTAS 
AND TARGETS FOR WOMEN AS A MEDIUM TERM STRATEGY AND WILL WORK WITH THE SOCIAL 
PARTNERS TO ACHIEVE REALISTIC TARGETS.
FIANNA F‡IL SUPPORT THE INCORPORATION INTO LEGISLATION OF EUROPEAN COURT 
DECISIONS WHICH PROVIDE THAT DISCRIMINATION ON THE GROUNDS OF PREGNANCY IS 
DIRECT DISCRIMINATION ON GROUNDS OF SEX AND IS THEREFORE UNLAWFUL. 

FIANNA F‡IL RECOGNISE THAT THERE ARE SOME INTERNAL FLAWS IN THE EXISTING 
MATERNITY PROTECTION LEGISLATION WHICH REQUIRE AMENDMENT TO STRENGTHEN A WOMANIS 
RIGHT TO RETURN TO WORK AFTER MATERNITY LEAVE.
 
FIANNA F‡IL WILL WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THE CONTINUING SUCCESS OF NOW, THE 
EUROPEAN UNION EQUAL OPPORTUNITY SCHEME. FIANNA F‡IL WILL END DISCRIMINATION IN 
CAR INSURANCE AGAINST SPOUSES OF POLICY HOLDERS, WHO AT PRESENT ARE NOT ENTITLED 
TO ANY NO CLAIM BONUS, IF THEIR SPOUSE DIES, EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN DRIVING 
SAFELY FOR YEARS.
  
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN

A RECENT SURVEY REVEALED THAT 11% OF WOMEN EXPERIENCED PHYSICAL VIOLENCE AND/OR 
SEXUAL VIOLENCE. TO ADDRESS VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN EFFECTIVELY FIANNA F‡IL WILL:

LEGISLATE FOR SEPARATE LEGAL REPRESENTATION FOR VICTIMS OF RAPE AND SEXUAL 
ASSAULT.

SECURE FUNDING FOR WOMENIS VOLUNTARY AGENCIES.

SET UP A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESOURCE UNIT.

PUT IN PLACE A TREATMENT PROGRAMME FOR SEXUAL OFFENDERS, AS WELL AS A REGISTER 
OF SEXUAL OFFENDERS.







A FAIR DEAL FOR CHARITABLE LOTTERIES

MANY CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS PURSUE CAUSES WHICH GREATLY ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF 
COMMUNITY LIFE, AND IN MANY INSTANCES CATER FOR THE ESSENTIAL NEEDS OF 
DISADVANTAGED FAMILIES. BUT LOTTERIES CONDUCTED BY CHARITIES HAVE BEEN ALMOST 
DRIVEN OUT OF BUSINESS BY THE IMPACT OF THE NATIONAL LOTTERY AND RECENTLY BY NEW 
COMPETITION FROM THE UK NATIONAL LOTTERY. 

THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE IS NO LIMIT ON PRIZES IN THE NATIONAL LOTTERY, WHERE 
THE JACKPOT ALONE CAN RUN INTO MILLIONS OF POUNDS,  BUT THE CHARITABLE LOTTERIES 
ARE STRICTLY LIMITED TO £10,000 IN PRIZES A WEEK. 

IN ADDITION, CHARITABLE LOTTERIES ARE OBLIGED BY LAW TO REPORT TO THE GARDA THE 
NAMES OF ALL PRIZE-WINNERS AND THE AMOUNT OF EACH PRIZE. THIS APPLIES EVEN TO 
SCRATCH CARDS AND PLACES A MAJOR COST ON THE CHARITABLE LOTTERIES. IT ALSO TAKES 
UP VALUABLE GARDA RESOURCES WHICH WOULD BE BETTER SPENT IN DEALING WITH CRIME.

FIANNA FAIL WILL IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THE CAP ON PRIZE LIMITS AND WILL ALSO REMOVE 
THE UNFAIR BURDEN OF ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING OF ALL PRIZES OF LESS THAN £1,000.
 

IMPROVE HOUSING PROSPECTS FOR ALL 

FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL

CONTINUE OUR INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO SOCIAL HOUSING

BRING ABOUT BETTER CO-ORDINATION AND CO-OPERATION BETWEEN AGENCIES IN THE 
HOUSING FIELD

GIVE GREATER SUPPORT TO THE FAST-GROWING VOLUNTARY HOUSING SECTOR

CARRY OUT RESEARCH INTO HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS

EXTEND THE SHARED OWNERSHIP SCHEME AND THE SALES SCHEME

LEGISLATE FOR SPEEDIER EVICTION OF ANTI-SOCIAL TENANTS AND SQUATTERS

ENCOURAGE RURAL RESETTLEMENT

ENCOURAGE HOME OWNERSHIP AND ALTERNATIVES BETWEEN RENTING AND FULL OWNERSHIP

INCREASE THE FIRST-TIME BUYERIS GRANT TO £5,000 FOR COUPLES

ENACT OUR DRAFT LEGISLATION TO ABOLISH GROUND RENTS 



HOUSING POLICY THAT ADAPTS TO CHANGE

IN 1990 FIANNA F‡IL BROUGHT INNOVATIVE CONCEPTS INTO OUR HOUSING POLICY SUCH AS 
SHARED OWNERSHIP. WE CREATED A FRAMEWORK FOR THE GROWTH OF THE VOLUNTARY HOUSING 
SECTOR. FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT THIS POLICY, 
SUITABLY ADAPTED TO MEET THE CHANGING SOCIETY IN WHICH WE LIVE. WE BELIEVE THERE 
IS AN URGENT NEED FOR BETTER CO-ORDINATION AND CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE VARIOUS 
AGENCIES INVOLVED IN SOCIAL HOUSING. WE WILL WORK TO CO-ORDINATE ALL AREAS 
INCLUDING RENT ALLOWANCES, SOCIAL SUPPORTS AND CARING.
WE WILL RESPOND TO THE NEED FOR MORE RESEARCH 
ON HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS, TO ENSURE A QUICKER AND MORE FLEXIBLE RESPONSE TO 
HOUSING NEEDS IN THE FUTURE. WE WILL ALSO MONITOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SOCIAL 
HOUSING POLICY TO ENSURE THEY DO NOT HAVE UNFORESEEN ADVERSE EFFECTS. FOR 
INSTANCE, WE MUST TAKE CARE THAT IN BUYING EXISTING HOUSES A LOCAL AUTHORITY 
DOES NOT DISTORT THE MARKET OR UPSET THE SOCIAL MIX OF AREAS.

KEY ELEMENTS OF HOUSING POLICY

FIANNA F‡IL WILL CONTINUE OUR COMMITMENT TO THE CONSTRUCTION AND 
ACQUISITION OF HOUSING UNITS BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES, AND WILL CONTINUE TO PUT 
RESOURCES INTO UPGRADING AND REFURBISHING.

WE WILL GIVE GREATER RECOGNITION TO THE GROWING IMPORTANCE OF THE VOLUNTARY 
HOUSING SECTOR, WITH EXTRA OVERALL RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN THE 
DETAILS OF EXISTING SCHEMES.

WE WILL PHASE IN A WELL-TARGETED SCHEME OF HOUSE REPAIR GRANTS.

WE WILL DEVELOP AND EXTEND THE SHARED OWNERSHIP SCHEME, REFLECTING INCREASED 
PROPERTY VALUES.

WE WILL DEVELOP THE SALES SCHEME, WITH GREATER DISCOUNTS FOR LONG-TERM 
TENANTS.

WE WILL TRANSFER THE RENT ALLOWANCE SCHEME INTO LOCAL AUTHORITY CONTROL, AND CO-
ORDINATE IT WITH THE EXISTING SCHEME OF LETTING PRIORITIES.

WE WILL MAKE THE MAXIMUM USE OF EXISTING HOUSING STOCK, WITH INCENTIVES TO 
ENCOURAGE ELDERLY PEOPLE TO MOVE TO SMALLER ACCOMMODATION DESIGNED FOR SENIOR 
CITIZENS.

WE WILL COMPLETE THE REGISTRATION OF PRIVATE RENTED DWELLINGS, AND ENFORCE 
STANDARDS AND CONTROLS FOR THE PROTECTION OF BOTH THE TENANT AND LANDLORD.

WE WILL IMPROVE TO CO-ORDINATION BETWEEN HOUSING, SOCIAL SUPPORT AND CARE, IN 
VIEW OF THE INCREASING NUMBER OF OLDER PEOPLE IN SOCIETY.

WE WILL AIM TO INTRODUCE BROADLY SIMILAR HOUSING SUPPORTS IN THE VARIOUS HOUSING 
CATEGORIES  LOCAL AUTHORITY, PRIVATE RENTED, AND THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR.

WE WILL IMPROVE AND FORMALISE ESTATE MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES.

WE WILL BRING IN NEW LEGISLATION FOR LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND PRIVATE LANDLORDS, SO 
THEY CAN SPEEDILY EVICT ANTI-SOCIAL TENANTS AND SQUATTERS.

WE WILL LOOK AT SETTING UP A HOUSING COURT TO DEAL WITH ALL LOCAL AUTHORITY AND 
PRIVATE HOUSING ISSUES.

WE WILL CONTINUE AND EXPAND THE POLICY OF SOCIAL INTEGRATION IN LOCAL 
AUTHORITY HOUSING. WE WILL EXTEND THIS TO THE PRIVATE RENT ALLOWANCE SECTOR BY 
INTRODUCING GUIDELINES OR LIMITS TO THE NUMBER OF RENT ASSISTED DWELLINGS IN ANY 
AREA.

WE WILL BRING IN TENANT TRAINING FOR ALL NEW TENANTS, AND CREATE BETTER 
AWARENESS, IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE TENANCY AGREEMENT.

TO REJUVENATE RURAL AREAS, WE WILL ENCOURAGE RURAL RESETTLEMENT AND BRING IN A 
£3,000 GRANT FOR THOSE SURRENDERING LOCAL AUTHORITY ACCOMMODATION TO PURCHASE IN 
RURAL AREAS.

WE WILL IMPROVE THE FIRST-TIME BUYER GRANT TO £5,000 WHERE THE HOUSE IS BEING 
BOUGHT IN THE JOINT NAMES OF A COUPLE.

WE WILL TERMINATE GROUND RENTS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR DRAFT BILL.

WE WILL ENCOURAGE INDIVIDUAL HOME OWNERSHIP AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN 
RENTAL AND FULL OWNERSHIP.   





















REVITALISING THE FABRIC OF OUR NATION
 
FOCUSING ON LEARNING NEEDS, NOT BUREAUCRACY

BRINGING SPORT AND LEISURE TO THE CENTRE OF THE NATIONAL STAGE

BALANCING OUR POPULATION BETWEEN URBAN AND RURAL AREAS

PUTTING NEW MOMENTUM INTO OUR TRANSPORT SYSTEM

COMPLETING THE TRANSFORMATION OF OUR ROADS SYSTEM

FOLLOWING NEW APPROACHES IN ENERGY
    














FOCUSING ON LEARNING NEEDS, NOT BUREAUCRACY
 
FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL

GIVE PRIORITY TO COMPUTER LITERACY, SCIENCE, LANGUAGES AND THIRD-LEVEL RESEARCH

COMMIT THE STATE TO PRE-SCHOOL EDUCATION

END THE RESOURCE STARVATION IN PRIMARY SCHOOLING

MANAGE CHANGE EFFECTIVELY AT SECOND LEVEL, AND SEARCH FOR A REPLACEMENT OF THE 
POINTS SYSTEM

MAKE A RADICAL ATTACK ON THE PROBLEM OF STUDENTS DROPPING OUT

SET UP A NATIONAL PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICE TO ADDRESS LEARNING DIFFICULTIES

BRING A COHERENT APPROACH TO FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION

IN A WORLD OF INCREASING CHANGE, FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE 
PRESERVE AND ENHANCE ALL THAT IS BEST IN IRISH EDUCATION WHILE ADAPTING PROMPTLY 
TO MEET NEW NEEDS AS THEY EMERGE.

WE CONSIDER THAT IN TODAYIS WORLD EDUCATION MUST BE A CONTINUUM, STRETCHING FROM 
THE EARLIEST CHILDHOOD YEARS, RIGHT THROUGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE, DURING ONEIS 
WORKING LIFE AND INTO THE DAYS OF RETIREMENT. 

AS WELL AS PROVIDING A GATEWAY TO EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION GENERATES A GREAT DEAL 
OF NATIONAL ACTIVITY IN IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE, PASSING ON VALUES, TRADITIONS, 
CULTURE AND HERITAGE  WHILE ENLIVENING EACH COMMUNITY WITH ITS OWN SENSE OF 
PLACE, AND EACH INDIVIDUAL WITH THEIR OWN SENSE OF WORTH AND POTENTIAL.

FIANNA F‡IL ARE IMMENSELY PROUD OF THE CENTRAL ROLE WE HAVE PLAYED IN CREATING 
AND DEVELOPING OUR PRESENT EDUCATION SYSTEM, WHICH IS RECOGNISED INTERNATIONALLY 
TO BE OF A VERY HIGH STANDARD.


GIVING PRIORITY TO COMPUTER LITERACY, SCIENCE, LANGUAGES AND THIRD-LEVEL 
RESEARCH

THROUGHOUT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM, THERE ARE CERTAIN KEY CHALLENGES CREATED BY THE 
NEW WORLD WE ARE MOVING INTO. FIANNA F‡IL WILL ADDRESS THESE DECISIVELY.

COMPUTER LITERACY. WE WILL INTRODUCE AN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MODULE TO BOTH 
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND WILL ENSURE A CROSS-CURRICULAR APPLICATION OF 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.  WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE AIM OF COMPUTER LITERACY FOR 
ALL STUDENTS BY THE TIME THEY LEAVE SCHOOL.
 
SCIENCE. WE WILL IMPLEMENT A PRACTICAL SCIENCE PROGRAMME AT PRIMARY LEVEL, BASED 
ON INDIVIDUAL EXPERIMENTS AND PROJECT WORK BY GROUPS OF PUPILS. WE WILL INITIATE 
A MAJOR REVIEW OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PRESENT SCIENCE TEACHING THROUGHOUT THE 
SYSTEM.
 
LANGUAGES. FIANNA F‡IL WILL INITIATE A MAJOR ANALYSIS OF ALL OUR LANGUAGE AIMS 
AND ACHIEVEMENTS, AS A BASIS FOR A NEW STRATEGY THAT DELIVERS EFFECTIVE FLUENCY 
TO ALL STUDENTS OF LANGUAGES AND EQUIPS IRELAND WITH THE LANGUAGE SKILLS 
NECESSARY FOR THE WORLD OF THE 21ST CENTURY.

THIRD-LEVEL RESEARCH. ALTHOUGH 80% OF RESEARCH IN IRELAND TAKES PLACE IN 
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES, OUR STRUCTURES DO NOT REFLECT THIS. WE WILL INCREASE 
THIRD-LEVEL REPRESENTATION ON THE SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION ADVISORY 
COUNCIL.

AS A PRIORITY, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THIRD LEVEL INSTITUTIONS AND THE BUSINESS 
SECTOR, WE WILL REASSESS THE FOCUS, ORGANISATION AND LEVEL OF INVESTMENT IN 
RESEARCH AND PUT IN PLACE A WIDE-RANGING 5-YEAR STRATEGIC PROGRAMME.
  

COMMITTING THE STATE TO PRE-SCHOOL EDUCATION

FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE THAT OUR STATE EDUCATION SYSTEM CAN NO LONGER NEGLECT THE
 IMPORTANCE OF PRE-SCHOOL EDUCATION. 
       
THIS NEGLECT REINFORCES DISADVANTAGE, AS TOO OFTEN THE LESS WELL-OFF CHILDREN 
START OFF IN SCHOOL ONE STEP BEHIND THOSE MORE FORTUNATE. AS WELL AS THIS, 
INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE SUGGESTS THAT EARLY INTERVENTION IS BY FAR THE BEST WAY 
OF IDENTIFYING AND DEALING WITH PERSONALITY PROBLEMS OR LEARNING DIFFICULTIES.

FIANNA F‡IL WILL SET UP A NATIONAL FORUM ON EARLY EDUCATION. ITS TASK WILL BE TO 
DRAW UP A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMME FOR PRE-SCHOOL PROVISION, TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN 
FULL OVER FIVE YEARS. 

PARENTS, TEACHERS, CHILDCARE EXPERTS AND WORKERS, VOLUNTARY AND STATUTORY 
ORGANISATIONS WILL ALL BE INCLUDED IN THIS FORUM. 

WE WILL CARRY OUT A NATIONAL RESEARCH PROJECT TO DETERMINE BEST EDUCATIONAL 
PRACTICE FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD. 

THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS, CARERS AND PARENTS, THE RECOGNITION OF QUALIFICATIONS, 
AND THE NEED TO ENHANCE THE STATUS OF EARLY EDUCATION ARE AMONG THE MATTERS THAT 
WILL BE ADDRESSED. 

INCLUDED IN THE REMIT OF THE FORUM WILL BE THE ISSUES OF URBAN AND RURAL 
ISOLATION, HOME-SCHOOL LIAISON, ASSESSMENT AND EARLY REFERRAL OF PROBLEMS.

FIANNA F‡IL WILL DESIGNATE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AS THE LEAD DEPARTMENT IN 
THE PROVISION OF EARLY CHILDCARE/EDUCATION, AND ALLOCATE A
SPECIFIC COMBINED BUDGET COVERING ALL THE DEPARTMENTS AND STATE AGENCIES 
INVOLVED. 

ENDING THE RESOURCE STARVATION IN PRIMARY SCHOOLING 

FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE THAT OUR PRIMARY SCHOOLS ARE CRITICALLY UNDER-RESOURCED, 
FOLLOWING 15 YEARS OF SEVERE CONSTRAINTS ON PHYSICAL MAINTENANCE, STAFFING AND 
ADMINISTRATIVE BACK-UP.

FIANNA F‡IL WILL PROGRESSIVELY, OVER THE LIFETIME OF THE NEXT GOVERNMENT, MAKE 
SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE RESOURCES DEVOTED TO THE NEEDS OF THE PRIMARY 
SECTOR.

THERE ARE NO ADEQUATE EXCUSES FOR SUB-STANDARD  SCHOOL BUILDINGS. WE WILL PUT IN 
PLACE AN ORDERED PROGRAMME OF BUILDING AND REFURBISHMENT TO TACKLE ALL THE MOST 
SERIOUS CASES OVER A 5-YEAR PERIOD. WE SEE ADMINISTRATIVE AND CARETAKING 
SERVICES AS BASIC NECESSITIES, AND WE WILL MAKE THEM AVAILABLE. WE WILL IMPROVE 
THE PUPIL/TEACHER RATIO BY KEEPING IN THEIR SCHOOLS THE TEACHERS WHO ARE FREED 
UP BY FALLING NUMBERS, THUS CONTINUING THE POLICY WE ADOPTED IN 1988.

WE WILL MAKE REMEDIAL TEACHERS AVAILABLE TO ALL PRIMARY SCHOOLS AND ENSURE AN 
ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF VISITING TEACHERS. WE WILL CREATE PANELS OF SUPPLY TEACHERS 
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, WITH POSITIONS AVAILABLE TO QUALIFIED TEACHERS ON BOTH A 
FULL-TIME AND PART-TIME BASIS. WHERE JOB-SHARING CAN IMPROVE THE EDUCATIONAL 
OUTCOMES FOR PUPILS AND HELP LESSEN THE BURDEN OF  TEACHING PRINCIPALS AND 
MULTIPLE-CLASS TEACHERS, WE WILL ENCOURAGE IT.  UNDER FIANNA F‡IL, STAFFING 
SCHEDULES WILL BE BASED ON A PROGRESSIVE REDUCTION OF CLASS SIZE, WITH 
PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE NEEDS OF MULTI-CLASS SCHOOLS.  WE WILL ADOPT A MORE 
FLEXIBLE APPROACH TO STAFFING SCHEDULES.
 

FIANNA F‡IL ARE DETERMINED TO ENSURE THE SURVIVAL OF RURAL SCHOOLS. THERE ARE 
OVER 800 ONE- AND TWO-TEACHER SCHOOLS. TEACHING PRINCIPALS AND MULTIPLE CLASSES 
ARE TWO KEY FEATURES OF THOSE SCHOOLS. WE WILL PROVIDE EXTRA TEACHING RESOURCES 
AND ANCILLARY STAFF TO ASSIST THE PRINCIPAL WITH ADMINISTRATION. ALL ONE-TEACHER 
SCHOOLS WILL GET A SECOND TEACHER AS PART OF FIANNA F‡ILIS OVERALL RURAL 
REGENERATION PROGRAMME. ALL TWO-TEACHER SCHOOLS WILL RETAIN THEIR SECOND 
TEACHER.

WITH THE IMMINENT ARRIVAL OF THE NEW PRIMARY CURRICULUM, THIS IS THE TIME TO MAP 
OUT A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMME OF IN-SERVICE TEACHER TRAINING AND CAREER 
DEVELOPMENT OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. FIANNA F‡IL ARE DETERMINED TO MAKE 
AVAILABLE FUNDING TO PREPARE TEACHERS ADEQUATELY FOR THE CHALLENGES OF THE NEW 
CURRICULUM.

WE WILL PLACE RENEWED STRESS ON BASIC LEARNING SKILLS  READING, WRITING, 
COMMUNICATION, NUMERACY  AND ON BUILDING UP EACH PUPILIS SELF-CONFIDENCE.

WE WILL ENCOURAGE OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES, SPORT, PROJECT WORK, ARTS AND CRAFTS, 
PARTICIPATION IN CLUBS AND HAVING HOBBIES. 
 
GAELSCOILEANNA

FIANNA F‡IL SUPPORTS THE RIGHTS OF PARENTS TO AN ALL-IRISH EDUCATION FOR THEIR 
CHILDREN. WE WILL, IN CONSULTATION WITH ALL INTERESTED PARTIES, DRAW UP AND 
IMPLEMENT A COMPREHENSIVE 5-YEAR PLAN TO CONSOLIDATE AND DEVELOP GAELSCOILEANNA 
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

WE WILL IMMEDIATELY SET UP A SPECIAL UNIT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 
WITH OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL POLICY ON GAELSCOILEANNA AND GAELTACHT 
SCHOOLS  INCLUDING POLICY TOWARDS EARLY RECOGNITION, SCHOOL BUILDINGS, TEXT-
BOOKS, AND TRAINING OF TEACHERS AND PARENTS. GAELSCOILEANNA AND GAELTACHT 
SCHOOLS WILL HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO THIS UNIT.

FIANNA F‡IL WILL IMPLEMENT THE COMMITMENT IN THE WHITE PAPER ON EDUCATION THAT 
FULL RECOGNITION AND FULL ENTITLEMENT TO CAPITAL GRANTS WILL BE GIVEN TO ALL-
IRISH SCHOOLS FROM THE DATE OF THEIR ESTABLISHMENT, AND ON MEETING AGREED 
CRITERIA.

MULTI-DENOMINATIONAL EDUCATION

FIANNA F‡IL WILL IMPLEMENT THE COMMITMENT IN THE WHITE PAPER ON EDUCATION THAT 
FULL RECOGNITION AND FULL ENTITLEMENT TO CAPITAL GRANTS WILL BE GIVEN TO MULTI-
DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS FROM THE DATE OF THEIR ESTABLISHMENT AND ON MEETING 
AGREED 
CRITERIA.
 
WE WILL ALSO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE TO EDUCATE TOGETHER, THE NATIONAL 
SUPPORT BODY FOR MULTI-DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. ACCESS TO FUNDING FOR TRAINING 
PARENTS IN
MANAGING THE SCHOOLS WILL ALSO BE PROVIDED.

MANAGING CHANGE EFFECTIVELY AT SECOND LEVEL
 
THE RECENT MAJOR CURRICULUM CHANGES AT SECOND LEVEL, HOWEVER WELCOME IN 
THEMSELVES, HAVE THROWN AN UNACCEPTABLE BURDEN ON SCHOOLS, TEACHERS AND STUDENTS 
BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE PLANNING AND TRAINING. 

MEANWHILE, THE STRESS FOR STUDENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE POINTS SYSTEM HAS 
INCREASED STILL FURTHER.

FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE THAT NOT ENOUGH ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE PRACTICAL 
ISSUES INVOLVED IN BRINGING ABOUT CHANGE AT SCHOOL LEVEL, NOR TO THE NEED TO 
PROTECT CORE SUBJECTS AS THE CURRICULUM EXPANDS. 
 
WE WILL PROVIDE THE SUPPORT NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT A BALANCED CURRICULUM. THE 
EFFECTIVE DELIVERY OF IN-SERVICE TRAINING, WHICH WILL NOT DISRUPT THE LEARNING 
EXPERIENCE OF STUDENTS, REQUIRES CAREFUL PLANNING, MAXIMUM CO-OPERATION BETWEEN 
THE PARTNERS IN EDUCATION, AND ADEQUATE FUNDING. FIANNA F‡IL IS COMMITTED TO 
THAT.


WE WILL APPOINT A HIGH-POWERED GROUP TO EXAMINE THE POINTS SYSTEM  A TRANSPARENT 
BUT PUNISHING SYSTEM  AND SEE IF AN EQUALLY TRANSPARENT BUT MORE HUMANE SYSTEM 
CAN BE DEVISED TO LOWER STRESS LEVELS, WHILE IMPROVING LEARNING TECHNIQUES AND 
ACCESS TO FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION. 

WE FAVOUR THE IDEA THAT STUDENTS PROGRESS THROUGH EDUCATION BY ACCUMULATING 
CREDITS, RATHER THAN BY OVER-RELIANCE ON ONCE-OFF FINAL EXAMS.
 
AN EFFECTIVE MIDDLE-MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE, A PROPER ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM AND IN-
CAREER TRAINING FOR SCHOOL PRINCIPALS MUST BE PROVIDED FOR, AND FIANNA F‡IL WILL 
ENSURE THAT. 

SPECIAL CONSIDERATION IN FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE GIVEN TO SMALLER SCHOOLS, 
PARTICULARLY THE 28% OF SCHOOLS WITH LESS THAN 300 PUPILS  SO THAT A WIDE CHOICE 
OF CURRICULAR OPTIONS IS AVAILABLE.

THE EVER-INCREASING EFFORTS OF PARENTS TO RAISE ADDITIONAL SCHOOL FUNDS REFLECTS 
THE MAJOR SHORTFALL IN DEPARTMENTAL FUNDING. 

FIANNA F‡IL WILL SIMPLIFY PRESENT FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS AND GIVE INCOME AND 
CORPORATION TAX RELIEF ON INDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE DONATIONS TO THE 
TECHNOLOGICAL, SCIENTIFIC OR SPORTING ACTIVITIES OF THE SCHOOL. 
  


MAKE A RADICAL ATTACK ON THE 
PROBLEM OF STUDENTS WHO DROP OUT

A REAL CAUSE OF CONCERN IS THE ALARMING NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO DROP OUT OF 
SECOND-LEVEL SCHOOLING WITHOUT ADEQUATE QUALIFICATIONS. THIS IS ESTIMATED AT 
ABOUT 20,000 EACH YEAR. FOR THESE MANY THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS, OUR SECONDARY 
EDUCATION IS NOT YET MEETING THEIR NEEDS. IT IS A FACT OF IRISH ECONOMIC LIFE 
THAT LACK OF QUALIFICATIONS CAN MEAN  INDEFINITE UNEMPLOYABILITY, AS WELL AS A 
DRIFT INTO DELINQUENCY AND CRIME. 

RADICAL INTERVENTION IS NECESSARY TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM EFFECTIVELY. FIANNA 
F‡IL ARE DETERMINED TO DO THIS.

WE WILL MAKE AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THIS EDUCATIONAL GAP, AND WORK WITH THE 
PARTNERS IN EDUCATION TO DESIGN CURRICULA THAT SUIT THE NEEDS OF ALL STUDENTS. 

WE WILL APPOINT SUFFICIENT EX-QUOTA REMEDIAL AND CAREER GUIDANCE TEACHERS.

WE WILL INCORPORATE MODULES ON SPECIFIC LEARNING DIFFICULTIES INTO ALL PRE-
SERVICE TEACHER TRAINING.

WE WILL REVIEW THE WHOLE AREA OF HOME/SCHOOL LIAISON, CAREER GUIDANCE AND 
COUNSELLING, SO THAT A PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR EACH STUDENT CAN BE MAPPED 
OUT  TO COMPLEMENT THEIR TALENTS, ADDRESS THEIR WEAKNESSES AND ASSESS THEIR 
EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS. 

WE WILL SUPPORT THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH LEARNING 
DISABILITIES WITH A BLOC GRANT, SO THEY CAN PROVIDE A MORE 
COMPREHENSIVE NATIONWIDE SERVICE FOR CHILDREN WHO HAVE SPECIFIC LEARNING 
DIFFICULTIES. FIANNA F‡IL HAVE PRODUCED A COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT ON DISABILITY 
WHICH INCLUDES A SPECIFIC AGENDA FOR ALL ASPECTS OF DISABILITY IN 
EDUCATION. THIS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ON FIANNA F‡ILIS RETURN TO GOVERNMENT, TO 
PROMOTE INDIVIDUAL EMPOWERMENT.

WE WILL EXTEND YOUTHREACH, THE SUCCESSFUL SCHEME LAUNCHED BY FIANNA F‡ILIS 
PRESENT LEADER AND DEPUTY LEADER IN 1989. THIS WORKS WELL WITH OVER 5,000 
STUDENTS EACH YEAR, BRINGING THEM THROUGH A STANDARD FOUNDATION STAGE AND THEN 
ON TO A PROGRESSION STAGE WHICH SHOULD LEAD TO EMPLOYMENT, FURTHER TRAINING, A 
RETURN TO SCHOOL OR SOME COMBINATION OF THOSE. YOUTHREACH HAS A SUCCESS RATE OF 
OVER 40%. TO EXTEND IT, WE WILL 

INITIATE A SERIES OF PILOT PROJECTS DESIGNED TO ASSIST UNDER-15S WHO ARE IN 
DANGER OF DROPPING OUT; CREATE NEW YOUTHREACH OPTIONS WITHIN THE CONTENT, 
CONTEXT AND STRUCTURES OF THE COURSE; 

INITIATE PILOT  YOUTHREACH PROJECTS THAT BRING TOGETHER MUCH 
SMALLER GROUPS WITH INDIVIDUAL TEACHERS, OVER AT LEAST AN 18-MONTH PERIOD, TO 
TRY AND BREAK THE CYCLE OF ALIENATION, FRUSTRATION, OR DISADVANTAGE.

BRINGING A COHERENT APPROACH TO FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION 

FIANNA F‡IL IS CONCERNED AT 

THE INAPPROPRIATE NATURE OF MANY OF THE PROPOSALS IN THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENTIS 
EDUCATION BILL; 

THE LACK OF APPRECIATION OF THE ROLE OF THE UNIVERSITIES EVIDENT IN THEIR WHITE 
PAPER ON SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION;

THE MISHANDLING OF ISSUES RELATING TO THE UPGRADING OF RTCS; AND 

THE UNSTRUCTURED WAY PLC COURSES ARE BEING DEVELOPED IN SECOND-LEVEL SCHOOLS AND 
COLLEGES OF FURTHER EDUCATION.

TO ADDRESS THESE AND OTHER URGENT ISSUES, FIANNA F‡IL WILL IMMEDIATELY 
COMMISSION AN EXPERT STUDY TO EXAMINE THE STRUCTURES AND PROCESSES WITHIN THE 
HIGHER AND FURTHER EDUCATION SECTORS, WITH A VIEW TO RECOMMENDING A MORE 
COHERENT AND CO-ORDINATED SYSTEM THAN EXISTS NOW.

THE SCOPE OF THE REVIEW WILL COVER ALL INSTITUTIONS WHICH OFFER PUBLICLY-FUNDED 
HIGHER AND FURTHER EDUCATION.  THE REVIEW WILL ALSO COVER THE STRUCTURES AND 
PROCESSES FOR CERTIFICATION, VALIDATION, ACCREDITATION, AND CONFERRING OF AWARDS 
FOR ALL PUBLICLY FUNDED PROGRAMMES. FIANNA F‡ILIS AIM IS TO PUT IN PLACE AT THE 
EARLIEST POSSIBLE DATE AN EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE INTEGRATED NATIONAL FRAMEWORK 
FOR HIGHER AND FURTHER EDUCATION.
 
POST LEAVING CERTIFICATE COURSES. THE PLCS, PIONEERED BY THE VECS, OFFER A WIDE 
RANGE OF DIVERSE COURSES CATERING FOR THE DEMANDS OF CURRENT JOB-TRENDS. THIS 
SECTOR WITH ITS 20,000 STUDENTS DESERVES TO BE SUPPORTED EQUITABLY. FIANNA F‡IL 
WILL FUND PLC STUDENTS ON THE SAME BASIS AS OTHER STUDENTS IN SIMILAR 
CIRCUMSTANCES AT THIRD LEVEL. 

PLC COLLEGES REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL INVESTMENT TO PROVIDE FACILITIES AND 
EQUIPMENT. FIANNA F‡IL WILL ACCELERATE THE CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME FOR 
FURTHER EDUCATION COLLEGES, USING EU STRUCTURAL FUNDING. WE WILL ALSO DEVELOP A 
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO PROVIDE TECHNOLOGICAL EQUIPMENT.

FIANNA F‡IL SEE THE PLCS AS PART OF AN OVERALL LADDER OF PROGRESSION WITHIN THE 
NATIONAL CERTIFICATION FRAMEWORK.  WE WILL ADVANCE THE PROGRESS MADE BY THE NCVA 
IN THIS REGARD, AND ENSURE THAT TEASTAS CREATES AN EFFECTIVE LADDER OF 
PROGRESSION THAT FACILITATES MOBILITY BETWEEN ALL POST-SECONDARY COURSES.
RESTORING AUTONOMY TO THIRD LEVEL

AT THIRD LEVEL, FIANNA F‡IL WILL RE-ESTABLISH THE PRINCIPLE OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM 
AND AUTONOMY, WHICH HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY UNDERMINED BY THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT. 

WE RECOGNISE THAT EACH THIRD-LEVEL INSTITUTION MUST BE FULLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR ALL 
MONEY IT RECEIVES FROM THE PUBLIC PURSE. BUT WE BELIEVE THAT MISSION STATEMENTS 
SHOULD NOT BE DICTATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OR ANY OUTSIDE BODY. WE 
BELIEVE THAT EACH THIRD-LEVEL INSTITUTION MUST BE ALLOWED DEVELOP WITHIN ITS OWN 
ETHOS AND TRADITIONS.

IN GOVERNMENT, FIANNA F‡IL WILL

PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE NEED FOR MORE SPACE FOR STUDENTS IN 
UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.

ENCOURAGE COLLEGES TO ADDRESS THE UNACCEPTABLY HIGH ATTRITION RATE IN MANY FIRST 
YEAR COURSES. GREATER EFFORTS MUST BE MADE TO INTEGRATE NEW STUDENTS INTO THE 
DIFFERENT LEARNING EXPERIENCE OF THIRD-LEVEL. 

IMPROVE PROVISIONS FOR POST-GRADUATE STUDENTS.

FACILITATE MAXIMUM ACCESS TO THIRD-LEVEL EDUCATION, BY ADJUSTING FINANCIAL 
ARRANGEMENTS WHICH AFFECT SECOND-CHANCE AND PART-TIME STUDENTS, AND BY REQUIRING 
ALL COLLEGES TO OPERATE ACCESS PROGRAMMES FOR DISADVANTAGED 
STUDENTS.

EXAMINE THE CASE MADE BY PRIVATE THIRD-LEVEL COLLEGES TO HAVE THEIR STUDENTS 
FEES PAID BY THE STATE. 

MAKE OBLIGATORY A SECURE SYSTEM OF BONDING FOR PRIVATE COLLEGES, TO ENSURE THAT 
STUDENTS OBTAIN THE COURSES THEY HAVE PAID FOR.

SET UP A CENTRALISED GRANT AUTHORITY TO DEAL WITH ALL APPLICATIONS AND 
PAYMENTS, AND ENSURE PROMPT PAYMENTS TO STUDENTS. THIS WILL INCLUDE AN 
INDEPENDENT APPEALS PROCEDURE.

DEVELOP A CO-ORDINATED HEALTH PROMOTION SCHEME FOR THIRD LEVEL COLLEGES. 
CURRENTLY THERE IS APPROXIMATELY ONE DOCTOR ON CAMPUS FOR EACH 8,500 
STUDENTS, WHICH IS CLEARLY INADEQUATE. THERE IS ALSO NEED FOR MORE CHILDCARE 
FACILITIES ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES, TO ALLOW MANY MORE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY OF 
ATTENDING THIRD LEVEL COURSES.  WE WILL IMPROVE FACILITIES FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE 
DISABLED, IN LINE WITH OUR COMPREHENSIVE OVERALL POLICY ON DISABILITY.
GIVING NEW IMPETUS TO ADULT EDUCATION

FIANNA F‡IL RECOGNISE THAT INCREASING ATTENTION MUST BE PAID TO ADULT EDUCATION. 
THIS MAY WELL BE THE FASTEST GROWING SECTOR OF IRISH EDUCATION, AND THERE IS 
EVERY INDICATION THAT IT WILL BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IN THE FUTURE. IT HAS 
PARTICULAR VALUE IN PROVIDING SECOND-CHANCE EDUCATION FOR THE DISADVANTAGED, AND 
IN CREATING A VEHICLE FOR LIFE-LONG 
LEARNING.

FIANNA F‡IL WILL EASE ADULT ACCESS TO EDUCATION BY REMOVING ANY BUREAUCRATIC 
RED-TAPE WHICH PREVENTS WOMEN IN PARTICULAR FROM  TAKING UP TRAINING OR 
EDUCATION.WE WILL INCREASE FUNDING TO THE NATIONAL ADULT LITERACY AGENCY WHICH 
HAS MADE TREMENDOUS STRIDES IN BRINGING THE SERIOUS PROBLEM OF ADULT ILLITERACY 
TO PUBLIC ATTENTION.
  
CREATING NEW STRUCTURES THAT ENHANCE LEARNING

FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE IN A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT OF RESPONSIBILITY DOWN TO THE 
INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL, AND IN SPENDING THE GREATEST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF EDUCATION 
RESOURCES ON IMPROVING THE LEARNING POSSIBILITIES FOR STUDENTS.

WE WILL ENCOURAGE FURTHER DEVOLUTION OF POWER TO SCHOOL BOARDS OF MANAGEMENT, 
AND WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE VITAL ROLE OF BOTH  PARENTS AND TEACHERS AS 
EDUCATION PARTNERS BECOMES A REALITY. WE WILL OFFER TRAINING TO MEMBERS OF 
MANAGEMENT BOARDS, TO HELP CLARIFY THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AND IDENTIFY CLEARLY 
THEIR ROLE. WE WILL PROVIDE FUNDING FOR MANAGEMENT AND PARENT ORGANISATIONS AT 
NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL, SO THEY CAN FULFIL THEIR ESSENTIAL ROLE IN OUR 
EDUCATION SYSTEM.

ALONG WITH DEVOLUTION, THERE IS NEED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR MORE POOLING OF 
RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE, AND BETTER CO-ORDINATION BETWEEN ALL PARTNERS IN 
EDUCATION. HOWEVER, FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE  THAT THE RIGHT WAY TO ACHIEVE THIS IS 
CERTAINLY NOT THROUGH THE VASTLY EXPENSIVE AND CUMBERSOME REGIONAL BOARDS 
PROPOSED BY THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT. 

FIANNA F‡IL WILL SET UP IN EACH AREA A COUNTY (OR CITY) EDUCATION FORUM. THE 
FORUM WILL EXPRESS THE LOCAL CONSENSUS OF OPINION ON MATTERS EDUCATIONAL, WITH 
THE AIMS OF ENSURING EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL, INNOVATING NEW SERVICES 
AND ENSURING THAT EVERY AVAILABLE EDUCATION POUND GOES INTO THE CLASSROOM. THE 
FORUM WILL PROVIDE A BASIS TO CO-ORDINATE LOCAL EDUCATION SERVICES, SHARE 
RESOURCES AND DEVELOP A PARTNERSHIP RESPONSE TO EDUCATION ISSUES. ALL PARTNERS 
IN EDUCATION WILL BE REPRESENTED. 

AT NATIONAL LEVEL, FIANNA F‡IL WILL SET UP A NATIONAL PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES 
BOARD TO SERVICE ALL PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS. THEIR REMIT WILL EXTEND TO 
PRE-SCHOOL CHILDREN, IN LIAISON WITH HEALTH AUTHORITIES, AND TO STUDENTS WHO 
DROP OUT OF SCHOOL AT LATE PRIMARY OR EARLY SECOND LEVEL. 
THIS SERVICE WILL BE INDEPENDENT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, BUT WILL WORK 
IN CLOSE CO-OPERATION WITH FAMILIES, SCHOOLS AND THE DEPARTMENT.

WE WILL BROADEN THE REMIT OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR CURRICULUM AND ASSESSMENT, 
WHICH HAS PLAYED A CENTRAL ROLE OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS CHARTING THE WAY FORWARD 
IN CURRICULUM CHANGE. WE WILL EXTEND THIS ROLE TO INCLUDE THE EVALUATION OF THE 
COUNCILIS OWN REFORMS, SO THAT CONTINUING CHANGE IS MADE A PERMANENT ELEMENT IN 
IRISH EDUCATION. WE WILL ALSO BROADEN THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE COUNCIL TO INCLUDE 
MORE EXPERTISE RELEVANT TO THE NEEDS OF THE MANY STUDENTS WHO DROP OUT FROM 
EDUCATION.

BRINGING SPORT AND LEISURE TO THE CENTRE OF THE NATIONAL STAGE

FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL

USE THE POTENTIAL OF SPORT AND LEISURE TO CREATE A HEALTHY SOCIETY

APPOINT A SENIOR MINISTER FOR SPORT, CREATE A NEW NATIONAL SPORTS BODY WITH 
GREATER POWERS, AND INCREASE LOTTERY FUNDING FOR THE AREA

APPOINT SPORT AND LEISURE OFFICERS AT LOCAL AUTHORITY LEVEL, AND COMMUNITY 
FACILITATORS FOR DISADVANTAGED AREAS

BUILD SPORT AND PHYSICAL TRAINING INTO THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM, INCLUDING THE 
ASSESSMENT PROCESS

ENCOURAGE JOINT VENTURES BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS TO PROVIDE 
NATIONAL AND REGIONAL FACILITIES, USING THE 50-METRE SWIMMING POOL AS A HEADLINE 
PROJECT

CREATE TAX AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO STIMULATE INVESTOR INTEREST
 
 
THE WIDER ROLE OF SPORT AND LEISURE

FIANNA F‡IL FULLY RECOGNISES THE VALUE OF SPORT AND LEISURE TO THE PHYSICAL AND 
MENTAL HEALTH OF EACH INDIVIDUAL. 

HOWEVER, OUR POLICY INITIATIVES IN THIS AREA STEM JUST AS MUCH FROM A BELIEF IN 
THE POTENTIAL OF SPORT AND LEISURE TO CREATE A HEALTHY SOCIETY, BASED ON VIBRANT 
COMMUNITIES WITH STRONG LOYALTIES AND ATTACHMENTS.

THERE IS AN IMPORTANT PLACE FOR SPORT AT THE TOP-PERFORMING OR EVEN INTERMEDIATE 
LEVELS OF COMPETITION. HOWEVER, THAT IS ONLY PART OF THE
PICTURE. 


THE REAL CHALLENGE, FOR IRELAND TODAY, IS TO DEVELOP POLICIES ON SPORT AND 
LEISURE WHICH CATER FOR THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. 

MANY OF OUR MOST ACUTE URBAN PROBLEMS, SUCH AS DRUGS AND CRIME, STEM FROM A LACK 
OF CONFIDENCE, SELF-ESTEEM AND SENSE OF PURPOSE,  PARTICULARLY ON THE PART OF 
YOUNG PEOPLE, MANY OF WHOM HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. OUR 
POLICY SEEKS TO HARNESS THE POTENTIAL OF  THE SPORT AND LEISURE AREA TO MOTIVATE 
YOUNG PEOPLE TO AVOID THE SCOURGE OF DRUGS AND CRIME. 

EQUALLY IMPORTANT, WE LOOK TO SPORT AND LEISURE FOR THE ROLE THEY CAN PLAY IN 
FOSTERING A SENSE OF COMMUNITY IDENTITY IN EVEN THE MOST DEPRIVED AND DEPRESSED 
AREAS.

SEVEN KEY INITIATIVES TO BRING SPORT AND LEISURE CENTRE STAGE

FIANNA F‡IL WILL:

SET UP A NEW DEPARTMENT OF  TOURISM AND SPORT. THIS RECOGNISES BOTH  THE NEED TO 
HAVE A SENIOR MINISTER WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR SPORT, AS WELL AS THE 
COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF THE TOURISM AND SPORT AND LEISURE SECTORS. (TRADE, WHICH 
IS AT PRESENT COUPLED WITH TOURISM IN ONE DEPARTMENT, WILL BE 
RELOCATED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF ENTERPRISE AND EMPLOYMENT.)


CREATE A NEW SPORTS BODY WITH GREATER AUTONOMY AND INCREASED POWERS, TO REPLACE 
THE EXISTING STRUCTURE. IT WILL HAVE A PRIMARY ROLE IN DECISIONS ON
 FUNDING AND ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF FACILITIES ON A NATIONAL AND REGIONAL BASIS.

ALLOCATE A LARGER SHARE OF NATIONAL LOTTERY FUNDING TO SPORT, IN LINE WITH THE 
ORIGINAL INTENTIONS FOR THE LOTTERY.

APPOINT SPORT AND LEISURE OFFICERS IN EACH COUNTY COUNCIL OR CORPORATION AREA. 
THEY WILL HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MANAGING THE SPORT AND LEISURE SECTOR IN THEIR 
AREA. TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS IN INNER CITY AND OTHER SIMILAR URBAN AREAS, WE 
WILL EMPLOY COMMUNITY RECREATIONAL FACILITATORS TO DEVELOP SPORT AND LEISURE AS 
AN ALTERNATIVE AND POSITIVE FOCUS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE.

APPOINT MORE PHYSICAL EDUCATION TEACHERS IN SCHOOLS, WHERE THE EMPHASIS SHOULD 
BE ON PARTICIPATION AND FUN RATHER THAN COMPETITION. WE WILL BUILD SPORT AND 
PHYSICAL TRAINING INTO THE CURRICULUM, AND PROFICIENCY IN IT WILL BE 
INCORPORATED INTO THE JUNIOR AND LEAVING CERTIFICATES AND THE POINTS SYSTEM.


ENCOURAGE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN STATE AND PRIVATE SECTOR FUNDING IN SPORT AND 
LEISURE PROJECTS, AND CREATE TAX RELIEFS AND OTHER INCENTIVES FOR PRIVATE 
INVESTORS TO STIMULATE MAXIMUM INTEREST IN THE SECTOR.

INVITE PROPOSALS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A 50-METRE SWIMMING POOL, TO SERVE BOTH 
AS AN INTERNATIONAL ARENA AND AS A QUALITY TRAINING FACILITY. THIS PROJECT WILL 
BE A HEADLINE FOR THE TYPE OF JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE 
SECTORS WHICH ARE NECESSARY FOR TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE FACILITIES NATIONWIDE.

















BALANCING OUR POPULATION BETWEEN URBAN AND RURAL AREAS

FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL

INITIATE A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMME OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO ENCOURAGE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN RURAL AREAS

CREATE DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES GEARED TO THE NEEDS OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT, AND 
ENCOURAGE RURAL ENTERPRISE BY ADJUSTING THE SOCIAL WELFARE MEANS TEST

PROVIDE STATE SERVICES AT LOCAL LEVEL, AND ACCELERATE THE DECENTRALISATION OF 
CENTRAL SERVICES

PROVIDE EQUAL QUALITY IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES THROUGHOUT ALL REGIONS

EQUALISE UTILITY CHARGES AND OTHER COSTS BETWEEN RURAL AND URBAN AREAS

DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMME TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OUR ISLANDS
 

ACTING WHILE THERE IS STILL TIME

FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE THAT THE TIME HAS NOW COME TO CREATE A RADICAL NEW PROGRAMME 
AIMED AT RESTORING THE BALANCE OF OUR POPULATION BETWEEN URBAN AND RURAL AREAS. 

IF WE DO NOT ACT NOW, MANY RURAL COMMUNITIES WILL LOSE THEIR VIABILITY AND THE 
DEPOPULATION TREND WILL BECOME IRREVERSIBLE. MEANWHILE, THE OVERBALANCED GROWTH 
OF OUR LARGE URBAN AREAS IS CREATING SOCIAL PROBLEMS WE CAN NO LONGER IGNORE. 
STIMULATING RURAL DEVELOPMENT WILL TAKE SOME OF THE INCREASING PRESSURE OFF OUR 
CITIES.

FIANNA F‡ILIS RURAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY IS BASED ON RECOGNISING A NUMBER OF BASIC 
REALITIES.

FIRST, PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS GO WHERE THE JOBS ARE. WITHOUT ADEQUATE EMPLOYMENT IN 
RURAL AREAS, DEPOPULATION IS INEVITABLE.

SECOND, AGRICULTURE CAN NO LONGER ON ITS OWN HOPE TO SUSTAIN RURAL COMMUNITIES. 
FIANNA F‡ILIS POLICY IS TO KEEP AS MANY FARM 
FAMILIES AS POSSIBLE ON THE LAND, BUT OTHER FORMS OF ACTIVITY MUST EXIST TO 
SUPPLEMENT THE CORE CONTRIBUTION THAT AGRICULTURE MAKES. INCREASINGLY, WE SEE 
FUTURE JOB CREATION IN RURAL AREAS IN THE SERVICES SECTOR.

THIRD, RURAL DEVELOPMENT CANNOT SUCCEED FULLY UNTIL PEOPLE IN RURAL AREAS CAN 
GET THE SAME RANGE AND QUALITY OF SERVICES AS IN URBAN AREAS  AND AT THE SAME 
PRICE. TOO OFTEN, PEOPLE LIVING AND WORKING IN RURAL AREAS DO SO UNDER A 
HANDICAP.

FOURTH, NEW TECHNOLOGY  PARTICULARLY IN COMMUNICATIONS  NOW OFFERS FOR THE FIRST 
TIME AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE ECONOMICALLY A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES AT TRULY 
LOCAL LEVEL. TECHNOLOGY NOW ALSO MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO RUN MANY MORE TYPES OF 
BUSINESS FROM A RURAL BASE.

ELEVEN STEPS ON THE ROAD TO POPULATION STABILITY
 
FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL

1   BEGIN AN ENERGETIC PROGRAMME OF LOCALISATION OF STATE SERVICES THAT ARE NOW 
PROVIDED CENTRALLY. WE WILL AIM TO MAKE THE COMPUTERISED LOCAL POST OFFICE A 
ONE-STOP SHOP FOR MOST STATE SERVICES, AND BRING AS MUCH ADMINISTRATION AS 
POSSIBLE DOWN TO THE REGIONAL AND COUNTY LEVEL. WE WILL APPLY THE PRINCIPLE THAT 
AS MUCH HEALTHCARE AS POSSIBLE IS PROVIDED LOCALLY, PARTICULARLY IN LONG-STAY 
AND RESIDENTIAL UNITS.

2   CONTINUE THE DECENTRALISATION OF STATE SERVICES. WE WILL PUT EMPHASIS ON 
MOVING SMALL, SELF-CONTAINED SECTIONS OF GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS TO TOWNS, WHERE 
AN INFLUX OF EVEN 30 OR 40 WELL-PAID SERVICE JOBS COULD REVITALISE A COMMUNITY. 
ALL STATE AGENCIES WHOSE MAIN FUNCTION IS TO SERVE RURAL NEEDS WILL BE 
RELOCATED. OTHER STATE AGENCIES WHICH DO NOT HAVE AN ESSENTIAL NEED TO BE IN 
DUBLIN WILL ALSO BE PROGRESSIVELY RELOCATED AROUND THE COUNTRY.

3  SIMPLIFY THE DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURE IN RURAL AREAS, DELIVERING SERVICES 
THROUGH A ONE-STOP SHOP SUCH AS THE COUNTY ENTERPRISE BOARD. WE WILL CREATE 
REGIONAL AGENCIES TO FOCUS ON RURAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY, AND ENCOURAGE A NATIONWIDE 
NETWORK OF COMMUNITY-CONTROLLED DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATIONS. 

WE WILL GIVE PRIORITY TO RURAL TOURISM, 
ENCOURAGING THE DEVELOPMENT OF NICHE PRODUCTS AND THE REFURBISHMENT OF SMALL 
HOTELS AND GUESTHOUSES.

4  ENCOURAGE RURAL ENTERPRISE BY ADJUSTING THE MEANS TEST FOR SOCIAL WELFARE 
BENEFITS. THIS CURRENTLY OPERATES SO AS TO LEAVE SELF-EMPLOYED PEOPLE NO BETTER 
OFF THROUGH WORKING. WE WILL DISREGARD ALL INCOME BELOW A CERTAIN THRESHOLD Ð 
FOR EXAMPLE, FARMERS WITH FIVE LIVESTOCK UNITS OR LESS, FISHERMEN WITH A BOAT OF 
LESS THAN 26 FEET. WE WILL ALSO ADDRESS THE MEANS TEST DIFFICULTIES OF 
PENSIONERS WITH SAVINGS.


5 SET UP FUNDING STRUCTURES THAT WILL ALLOW LOCAL MONEY TO FIND AN OUTLET IN 
LOCAL DEVELOPMENT, RATHER THAN BEING SUCKED OUT OF RURAL AREAS.

6   PROVIDE ALL REGIONS WITH A BROAD EQUALITY OF BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE FOR 
EXAMPLE, ROADS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, AIRPORTS, WATER, SEWERAGE, NATURAL GAS. WE 
WILL ENSURE THAT THE NEW TECHNOLOGY IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS (SUCH AS ISDN) IS 
FULLY AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE, ON AN EQUAL BASIS. WE WILL ACTIVELY DEVELOP THE SIX 
REGIONAL AIRPORTS AS ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CATALYSTS FOR THE AREAS THEY SERVE. WE 
WILL ENCOURAGE THE SMALL-SCALE DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF ENERGY AT 
LOCAL LEVEL. WE WILL SPEED UP LOCAL IMPROVEMENT SCHEMES, CUTTING THE 
WAITING LISTS TO UNDER ONE YEAR WITHIN THE LIFETIME OF THE NEXT GOVERNMENT (AT 
PRESENT, SCHEMES CAN WAIT UP TO EIGHT YEARS TO BE REALISED).

7  ESTABLISH THE PRINCIPLE OF UNIFORM CHARGES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY FOR 
SERVICES SUCH AS TELECOMMUNICATIONS,ELECTRICITY,SEWERAGE/REFUSE DISPOSAL, ETC. 
THIS WOULD ALSO APPLY TO INSTALLATION CHARGES, WHICH CAN BE CRIPPLING IN RURAL 
AREAS. WHERE RURAL BUSINESSES ARE AT A COST DISADVANTAGE (FOR INSTANCE, BECAUSE 
THEY TEND TO PAY MORE IN TAXES ON TRANSPORT), WE WILL SEEK TO REDRESS THE 
BALANCE.

8   PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF RURAL POLICING, AND PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO OLD 
PEOPLE TO PROTECT THEIR HOUSES AGAINST BURGLARY. WE WILL KEEP OPEN RURAL GARDA 
STATIONS, AND ENCOURAGE GARDA' TO LIVE WHERE THEY WORK.

9   MAINTAIN THE NUMBER OF RURAL SCHOOLS, PROVIDE A SECOND TEACHER FOR ALL ONE-
TEACHER SCHOOLS, AND ENSURE THAT RURAL SCHOOLS ARE NOT DISADVANTAGED BECAUSE OF 
THEIR SIZE IN TERMS OF THE RANGE OF SUBJECTS THEY CAN OFFER. WE WILL REVAMP THE 
SCHOOL TRANSPORT SYSTEM TO REDUCE DRASTICALLY THE DISTANCE CHILDREN HAVE TO WALK 
EACH DAY TO GET A BUS. WE WILL PROVIDE RESOURCE AND REMEDIAL TEACHERS, BASED ON 
PUPIL NEED IN EACH SCHOOL. WE WILL ENSURE THAT A WIDE RANGE OF PLC COURSES ARE 
AVAILABLE IN RURAL TOWNS, ANDS DEVELOP OUT-REACH CAMPUSES FOR RTCS AND 
UNIVERSITIES.
10   REVIEW HOUSING REGULATIONS AND PRACTICES TO MAKE IT EASIER AND CHEAPER TO 
BUILD 
HOUSES IN RURAL AREAS, AND TO ENCOURAGE 
RELOCATION OF PEOPLE TO RURAL AREAS.

11   SEEK, AT EU LEVEL, OBJECTIVE I STATUS AFTER 1999 FOR ALL RURAL AREAS 
SUFFERING FROM POPULATION DECLINE.

ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF OUR ISLANDS

OUR INHABITED ISLANDS SUFFER ALL THE PROBLEMS FACED BY OTHER RURAL AREAS, WITH 
ADDITIONAL HANDICAPS BECAUSE OF THEIR REMOTENESS. FIANNA F‡IL WILL ADOPT AN 
INTEGRATED APPROACH TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND EQUAL ACCESS TO 
OPPORTUNITIES OF THE PEOPLE WHO KEEP OUR ISLANDS INHABITED. THE MAIN ISSUES 
REQUIRING ACTION CONCERN BASIC SERVICES,  LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE, ACCESS COSTS, 
AND EDUCATION.

WE WILL ANALYSE THE ACCESS NEEDS OF THE ISLANDS, AND DRAW UP A 5-YEAR PLAN TO 
ENSURE THAT EVERY ISLAND HAS SUBSIDISED FERRY ACCESS AND ADEQUATE PIERS. WHERE 
THERE IS AN ACCESS PROBLEM IN THE WINTER AND NO AIRSTRIPS EXIST, A REGULAR 
HELICOPTER SERVICE WILL BE PROVIDED DURING WINTER AND EMERGENCY COVER ALL YEAR. 
WE WILL EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF MORE AIRSTRIPS, PARTICULARLY TO TORY ISLAND, 
CLARE ISLAND, INISHTURK AND INISHBOFIN.

WE WILL PROVIDE ACCESS TO ALL BASIC SERVICES, INCLUDING HEALTHCARE, OF A QUALITY 
AND AT A PRICE COMPARABLE TO THAT AVAILABLE ON THE MAINLAND.

FOR THOSE ISLANDS WITHOUT ENOUGH POPULATION TO SUSTAIN A SECONDARY SCHOOL, THE 
REMOTE AREA GRANT WILL BE IMPROVED AND MEANS TESTING OF IT ABOLISHED. EVERY 
EFFORT WILL BE MADE TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS FROM THE ISLANDS ARE ABLE TO RETURN 
HOME AS REGULARLY AS POSSIBLE.

WE WILL CREATE A SPECIAL ISLANDER ALLOWANCE, TO OFFSET THE HIGHER COST OF LIVING 
ON THE ISLANDS.  WE WILL ADJUST THE SOCIAL WELFARE MEANS TEST TO ENCOURAGE 
ENTERPRISE.

WE WILL ENCOURAGE ALL ISLANDS TO HAVE A FULL-TIME DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION FUNDED 
UNDER A SCHEME SIMILAR TO THE SCHEME OPERATED BY ŒDAR‡S NA GAELTACHTA FOR THE 
COMHARCHUMAINN GAELTACHTA. THESE ASSOCIATIONS WILL WORK WITH GOVERNMENT 
DEPARTMENTS, COUNTY COUNCILS AND STATE AGENCIES IN A PARTNERSHIP FOR DEVELOPING 
THE ISLANDS.

PUTTING NEW MOMENTUM INTO OUR TRANSPORT SYSTEM

FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL

OPEN UP NEW AIR LINKS WITH THE US AND THE PACIFIC RIM

ENCOURAGE REGIONAL AIRLINES AND REGIONAL AIRPORTS

CAMPAIGN IN EUROPE FOR THE CONTINUANCE OF DUTY-FREE SHOPPING

INVEST IN THE MAIN LINE RAIL NETWORK, INCLUDING HIGH-SPEED LINKS

REGENERATE PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN DUBLIN

UNDO THE MISTAKES OF THE LIGHT RAIL PROJECT, AND SPEED UP ITS COMPLETION

FUND TRANSPORT INVESTMENTS IN INNOVATIVE WAYS
 
 
DEVELOPING NEW AIR LINKS

FIANNA F‡IL WILL AGGRESSIVELY DEVELOP TO THE FULL IRELANDIS AIR LINKS WITH THE 
REST OF THE WORLD. WE BELIEVE THEY ARE A VITAL PART OF OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH 
OVERALL AND PARTICULARLY OUR TOURISM.

WE WILL ABOLISH LANDING CHARGES FOR NEW ROUTES OPERATED TO IRISH AIRPORTS FOR A 
FIVE-YEAR PERIOD. THIS MOVE HAS TWIN AIMS: TO ENCOURAGE HUB OPERATIONS AT DUBLIN 
AND SHANNON BY MAJOR US CARRIERS, AND TO ENCOURAGE DIRECT LINKS BETWEEN IRELAND 
AND THE COUNTRIES OF THE PACIFIC RIM. SUCH A PRICING POLICY WILL EXPLOIT THE 
SEVERE CAPACITY CRUNCH THAT IS ARISING IN LONDON THROUGH THE SHORTAGE OF SLOTS 
AT HEATHROW.

N        WE WILL ALSO OFFER SPECIAL LANDING-FEE ARRANGEMENTS FOR AIRLINES 
BRINGING PASSENGERS TO IRELAND TO LINK UP WITH CRUISES. (THIS WILL BE PART OF AN 
OVERALL POLICY TO INCREASE THE USE OF IRELAND AS A CRUISING BASE.)

N        WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SHANNON AIRPORT A KEY FOCUS FOR THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE MID-WEST REGION.
   
N WE WILL TREAT AER LINGUS AS THE MAJOR NATIONAL ASSET IT IS, ESPECIALLY SINCE 
THE INVESTMENT OF £175 MILLION OF TAXPAYERSI MONEY. FIANNA F‡IL CONDEMN THE 
HANDLING OF THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE PROPOSED BY THE PRESENT MINISTER, AND IN 
PARTICULAR THE FAILURE TO CONSULT WITH AER LINGUS UNIONS AND EMPLOYEES.
  
N WE WILL USE THE BUSINESS EXPANSION SCHEME TO ENCOURAGE REGIONAL AIRLINES.

N        AS SET OUT IN OUR POLICY DOCUMENT, WE WILL SUPPORT THE NETWORK OF 
REGIONAL AIRPORTS  WHICH WE BACKED WHILE OTHER PARTIES DOUBTED THEM. WE WILL 
FACILITATE THE USE OF THE BUSINESS EXPANSION SCHEME TO DEVELOP AND MARKET THESE 
AIRPORTS, AND WE WILL REVAMP THE MARKETING FUND FOR THEM. OUR AIM IS TO MAKE 
REGIONAL AIRPORTS MORE ATTRACTIVE TO TRAVELLERS THROUGH ENHANCED FACILITIES.
  
N WE WILL STRONGLY RESIST EU PLANS TO ABOLISH DUTY-FREE SHOPPING AFTER JUNE 
1999. DUTY-FREE SHOPPING GENERATES MORE THAN £100 MILLION FOR IRISH 
COMPANIES, AND THOUSANDS OF IRISH JOBS DEPEND ON IT. WE ARE APPALLED AT THE WEAK 
EFFORT OF THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT TO DEFEND IRISH INTERESTS. WE BELIEVE THERE IS 
AN UNANSWERABLE CASE TO CONTINUE DUTY-FREE FOR SEVERAL YEARS BEYOND 1999, AS 
THERE ARE STILL WIDELY-DIVERGENT TAX RATES IN THE EU ON WINE, BEER AND OTHER 
GOODS.
  

INVESTING IN THE RAIL SYSTEM

FIANNA F‡IL ARE COMMITTED TO INVESTMENT IN THE MAINLINE RAIL NETWORK AND IN THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH SPEED SERVICES. 

N WE WILL PROVIDE FOR SPECIAL INVESTMENT IN HIGH-SPEED INTERCITY RAIL. 
N WE WILL REQUIRE ALL NEW TRAIN STATIONS TO HAVE SUFFICIENT PARKING, THE COST TO 
BE SHARED BY IARNR-D ŽIREANN AND THE LOCAL AUTHORITY THAT BENEFITS FROM REDUCED 
TRAFFIC.
N WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARROW-TYPE RAILCAR SERVICES ON 
RURAL LINES, TO PROVIDE RENEWED AND MORE FREQUENT SERVICE.

N WE WILL IMPROVE PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN CORK, IN THE SPIRIT OF THE ORIGINAL 
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE LAND USE TRANSPORTATION STUDY. WE WILL CAREFULLY CONSIDER 
RE-OPENING OF THE RAILWAY LINE TO MIDLETON AND EVENTUALLY YOUGHAL, AND THE 
OPENING OF THE NON-COMMUTER STATIONS FROM THE NORTH SIDE OF CORK THROUGH TO 
COBH.

REGENERATING PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN DUBLIN

N DUBLIN CANNOT REMAIN THE ONLY EUROPEAN 
CAPITAL WITHOUT A RAIL LINK TO ITS INTERNATIONAL 
AIRPORT. AS A MATTER OF URGENCY WE WILL DEVELOP,
 POSSIBLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH AER RIANTA, A RAIL CONNECTION BETWEEN DUBLIN 
AIRPORT AND THE CITY CENTRE USING THE MAINLINE RAIL NETWORK, DART OR LIGHT RAIL.

N WE ARE COMMITTED TO UPGRADING SUBURBAN RAIL LINKS. WE WILL GIVE PRIORITY TO 
UPGRADING AND DOUBLING THE MAYNOOTH LINE, AND WILL OPEN A COMMUTER 
STATION AT MONASTEREVAN. WE WILL ACCELERATE EXTENDING THE DART TO GREYSTONES AND 
MALAHIDE AND OPENING NEW STATIONS AT FAIRVIEW AND BARROW STREET. WE WILL 
TRANSFORM THE TOTALLY OVERCROWDED AND INADEQUATE RAIL
 SERVICE FROM BALBRIGGAN TO DUBLIN, BY PROVIDING EXTRA CARRIAGES AND TRAINS AT 
PEAK TIMES AND BY IMPROVING THE TIMETABLE AND ANCILLARY FACILITIES.

N  WE WILL MAKE IT A CONDITION OF PLANNING PERMISSION FOR HOUSING ESTATES THAT 
THEIR IMPACT ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT BE ADDRESSED. MANY BUS ROUTES ARE UNCHANGED FOR 
30 YEARS DESPITE HUGE POPULATION CHANGES. AS PART OF THE REVAMP OF ROUTES, WE 
WILL CREATE NEW CROSS-CITY ROUTES.

N WE WILL ATTACK TRAFFIC CONGESTION THROUGH A CO-ORDINATED TRAFFIC PLAN FOR 
DUBLIN CITY AND COUNTY.  THIS WILL PROVIDE FOR BY-PASSES, PEDESTRIANISATION, 
DISC PARKING, AND THE CONTRACTING OUT OF CLAMPING.

N WE AIM TO EXTEND DART OPERATING HOURS TO CONTINENTAL NORMS(6AM TO ABOUT 1AM). 
WE WILL DEVELOP FURTHER LATE NIGHT BUS SERVICES. 
  
GETTING THE LIGHT RAIL PROJECT RIGHT

MANAGEMENT OF THE LIGHT RAIL PROJECT UNDER THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN 
NOTHING SHORT OF DISASTROUS. LUAS IS BEHIND SCHEDULE, CONSULTATION HAS BEEN 
TOTALLY INADEQUATE, AND SOME OF THE DECISIONS TAKEN SO FAR APPEAR AT THE VERY 
LEAST QUESTIONABLE. FIANNA F‡IL WILL RE-ENERGISE THE LIGHT RAIL PROJECT, WHILE 
FULLY ADDRESSING THE REAL CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED BY A WIDE RANGE OF 
PEOPLE.

KEY ASPECTS OF OUR POLICY ON LIGHT RAIL ARE:

N LIGHT RAIL CANNOT DELIVER ITS POTENTIAL UNLESS THE SCHEME IS COMPLETED IN ITS 
ENTIRETY. FIANNA F‡IL WILL THEREFORE BUILD ALL THREE DUBLIN LIGHT RAIL LINES  TO 
SANDYFORD, TALLAGHT AND BALLYMUN.
   
N THE OPTION OF PUTTING LIGHT RAIL UNDERGROUND IN THE CITY-CENTRE AREA HAS NOT 
BEEN PROPERLY 
EXAMINED. FIANNA F‡IL WILL COMMISSION A FAST-TRACK INDEPENDENT STUDY OF THIS 
OPTION, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME INVESTIGATING THE 
POSSIBILITY OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM EU OR OTHER SOURCES. AS THE STATUTORY 
INQUIRY IS LIKELY TO INSIST ON FULLY EXAMINING THE UNDERGROUND OPTION, CARRYING 
OUT THIS STUDY WILL NOT IN FACT DELAY THE 
PROJECT.

N CONCERN OVER THE DISRUPTION THAT WILL CERTAINLY BE CAUSED DURING THE 
CONSTRUCTION OF LUAS HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY ADDRESSED. BUILDING ON THE EXPERIENCE 
OF CITIES ELSEWHERE, FIANNA F‡IL WILL APPOINT A SPECIAL PLANNER WHOSE SOLE JOB 
WILL BE TO MINIMISE DISRUPTION. THIS PLANNER WILL HAVE OVER-RIDING POWER TO 
FORCE ALL STATE UTILITIES TO CO-ORDINATE THEIR SERVICE WORK; THIS WILL STOP 
REDIGGING OF STREETS AFTER THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISRUPTED. THE LUAS PLANNER 
WILL ALSO INFORM THE PUBLIC IN ADVANCE OF IMPENDING DISRUPTION AND WILL AGREE A 
TIMETABLE OF STREET CHANGES AND ALTERATIONS.

N IN ITS PRESENT FORM, LUAS IS NOT PROPERLY INTEGRATED WITH THE REST OF DUBLINIS 
PUBLIC TRANSPORT. FIANNA F‡IL WILL FULLY INTEGRATE LIGHT RAIL WITH THE DART AND 
WITH BUS SERVICES, AND EXTEND THE LINES WHERE OBVIOUS TRAFFIC POTENTIAL OR NEED 
EXISTS (SUCH AS TO SANDYFORD INDUSTRIAL ESTATE, THE IFSC, AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS 
IN THE DOCKLANDS). TICKETS BETWEEN THE LUAS, DART AND BUSES WILL BE FULLY 
INTERCHANGEABLE.
  

LOOKING FOR NEW WAYS TO FUND TRANSPORT

WHERE PROJECTS HAVE PARTICULAR FINANCIAL BENEFITS FOR COMMERCIAL ORGANISATIONS, 
WE WILL SEEK COMMERCIAL PARTICIPATION IN THE INVESTMENT  IN RETURN FOR A SAY IN 
THE RUNNING, ROUTING AND SCHEDULING OF SERVICES THROUGH A JOINT MANAGEMENT 
COMMITTEE. POSSIBLE PROJECTS INCLUDE EXTENDING LIGHT RAIL TO DUBLINIS DOCKS AND 
CREATING A RAIL LINK TO THE AIRPORT IN CONJUNCTION WITH AER RIANTA.

COMPLETING THE 
TRANSFORMATION OF OUR ROADS SYSTEM

FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL

MAINTAIN AND IF POSSIBLE ACCELERATE THE UPGRADING OF NATIONAL PRIMARY ROUTES

PROVIDE MORE ADEQUATE FUNDING TO MAINTAIN THESE ROUTES IN OPTIMUM CONDITION

GIVE PRIORITY TO UPGRADING IMPORTANT NATIONAL SECONDARY ROUTES

ENSURE INCREASED FUNDING TO MAINTAIN REGIONAL AND COUNTY ROADS

GIVE LOCAL AUTHORITIES MORE FLEXIBILITY ON HOW THEY USE THEIR OWN RESOURCES ON 
COUNTY ROADS
 
 
A KEY ELEMENT OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE

FIANNA F‡IL WILL MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF SPENDING ON ROADS. THEY ARE AN 
ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF OUR INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE, FACILITATING PERSONAL 
MOBILITY, COMMERCE AND TOURISM. IN THE FUTURE, IT IS INEVITABLE THAT OUR ROADS 
WILL BE UNDER MORE PRESSURE AS WE APPROACH CLOSER TO AVERAGE EUROPEAN LEVELS OF 
CAR OWNERSHIP.

FIANNA F‡IL FULLY RECOGNISE, HOWEVER, THAT ROADS ARE ONLY ONE PART OF OUR 
OVERALL NATIONAL TRANSPORT STRATEGY. EFFICIENT PUBLIC TRANSPORT IS VITAL, TO 
KEEP OUR ROADS FREE OF CONGESTION AND TO PREVENT OUR ENVIRONMENT BEING TOTALLY 
SACRIFICED TO THE NEEDS OF VEHICLE USERS.

SINCE THE LATE 1970S, FIANNA F‡IL HAS CONCENTRATED A MAJOR SHARE OF PUBLIC 
INVESTMENT FUNDING, BOTH DOMESTIC AND EUROPEAN, ON MODERNISING OUR ROADS. 
SPENDING WAS DOUBLED IN OUR 1981 INVESTMENT PLAN, AND OUR NEGOTIATION OF MASSIVE 
INCREASES IN EU FUNDING IN 1989 AND 1993 HAS ENABLED A MAJOR ACCELERATION OF 
ROAD SPENDING. THIS IS NOW TRANSFORMING OUR ROAD NETWORK.


 OUR GENERAL OBJECTIVES ON ROADS ARE:

N TO MAINTAIN AND, IF RESOURCES PERMIT, 
ACCELERATE THE UPGRADING OF OUR NATIONALPRIMARY ROUTES;

N TO PROVIDE MORE ADEQUATE FUNDING TO MAINTAIN THESE ROADS IN OPTIMUM CONDITION;

N TO DEVELOP AS A PRIORITY A MORE AMBITIOUS PROGRAMME FOR UPGRADING IMPORTANT 
SECONDARY NATIONAL ROUTES, WHICH ARE AT PRESENT SERIOUSLY 
NEGLECTED;

N TO ENSURE THAT INCREASED FUNDING CONTINUES TO BE AVAILABLE TO MAINTAIN ALL 
REGIONAL AND COUNTY ROADS TO AN ACCEPTABLE STANDARD. 
 
NATIONAL PRIMARY ROADS

WE WILL COMPLETE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE DUBLIN RING ROAD;

OUR TARGET WILL BE TO UPGRADE THE DUBLIN ROAD TO THE BORDER TO CONTINUOUS 
MOTORWAY STANDARD BY 2005;

WE WILL AIM TO PROVIDE CONTINUOUS MOTORWAY TO KINNEGAD FOR ALL ROUTES TO THE 
WEST AND NORTH-WEST, AND TO HAVE MOTORWAY STANDARD TO PORTLAOISE BY 2005; 

WE WILL COMPLETE THE UPGRADING OF THE NAAS DUAL CARRIAGEWAY, PENDING THE 
CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW MOTORWAY BY 2005;

WE WILL GIVE PRIORITY TO IMPROVING NATIONAL ROUTES IN OR BETWEEN MAJOR CITIES OR 
PORTS LIKE ROSSLARE, WATERFORD, CORK, LIMERICK, GALWAY AND SLIGO; TO 
STRENGTHENING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN REGIONS AS WELL AS THE RADIAL ROUTES TO AND 
FROM DUBLIN; AND IN PARTICULAR TO ALLEVIATING POINTS OF SEVERE CONGESTION (E.G. 
ON THE SHANNON-ENNIS ROAD), INCLUDING BOTTLENECKS ON THE PERIPHERY OF OUR MAJOR 
CITIES.
  
NATIONAL SECONDARY ROADS

WE WILL GIVE PARTICULAR PRIORITY TO A SERIOUS PROGRAMME OF UPGRADING THE MORE 
IMPORTANT MAIN TOURIST ROADS (WITH FULL REGARD TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 
IN AREAS OF HIGH AMENITY) AND OTHER ROADS OF ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE.

WE WILL ALSO UPGRADE SECONDARY ROADS BETWEEN IMPORTANT TOWNS. AS A PRIORITY, WE 
WILL PROVIDE A SECOND RIVER CROSSING IN WATERFORD.
  
REGIONAL, COUNTY AND URBAN ROADS

COUNTY ROADS ARE IN A SERIOUS STATE OF DISREPAIR AND NEED TO BE GIVEN HIGHER 
PRIORITY. WHILE THE AMOUNTS ALLOCATED TO NATIONAL ROADS HAVE INCREASED OVER THE 
PAST FIVE YEARS, MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO PROVIDE A REASONABLE STANDARD OF 
ROADS IN RURAL IRELAND. FIANNA F‡ILIS ÒREAL LOCAL GOVERNMENTÓ WILL ENSURE THAT 
PRIORITY, BY ALLOWING LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO RETAIN A PROPORTION OF MOTOR TAXATION 
SPECIFICALLY TO FUND WORKS ON COUNTY ROADS, AND BY GIVING LOCAL AUTHORITIES MUCH 
MORE DISCRETION OVER THEIR SPENDING.

SAFETY AND DIRECTIONS

ROAD IMPROVEMENTS WILL INCREASE SAFETY AND REDUCE DEATH AND INJURY. WE WILL 
PROVIDE MARKINGS ON ALL ROADS OF A WIDTH WHERE THIS IS PRACTICABLE, AND 
ESPECIALLY ON DANGEROUS BENDS. WE WILL HAVE SIGNPOSTS  PUT UP AT ALL CROSSROADS 
AND JUNCTIONS.

ENVIRONMENT

WHERE A NEW ROAD OR MAJOR ROAD IMPROVEMENT IS TO TAKE PLACE, THERE WILL BE 
PROPER CONSULTATION WITH RESIDENTS, LANDOWNERS AND OTHERS AFFECTED. WE BELIEVE 
MORE PRE-PLANNING CONSULTATION WILL MEAN DECISIONS CAN BE TAKEN MORE 
EXPEDITIOUSLY AND WILL REDUCE UNNECESSARY CONFLICTS AND CONFRONTATION.

DUE REGARD WILL BE PAID TO THE NEEDS OF SAFETY OF PEOPLE CROSSING, TO ENSURING 
THAT ANY DIVISION OF LAND AND COMMUNITIES IS PROPERLY BRIDGED, TO NOISE 
POLLUTION AND EFFECTS ON VISUAL AND OTHER AMENITIES, AND TO FACILITIES FOR 
ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 

IN LINE WITH OUR COMMITMENT TO ÒPEOPLE BEFORE POLITICSÓ, DIVISION OF COMMUNITIES 
TO FACILITATE ROADWORKS WILL BE AVOIDED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

FUNDING

INCREASED FUNDING FOR ROADS HAS TO BE FOUND WITHIN BUDGETARY PARAMETERS. WHILE 
SOME INCREASED FUNDING IS REQUIRED FOR NATIONAL ROAD DEVELOPMENT AND 
MAINTENANCE, AS WELL AS FOR COUNTY AND REGIONAL ROADS, NEW EXPENDITURE IS 
REQUIRED TO DEVELOP A PROGRAMME FOR IMPROVING OUR NATIONAL SECONDARY ROADS.

N FIANNA F‡IL WILL COMPLETE THE PRESENT OPERATIONAL PROGRAMME, MATCHING 
EXCHEQUER FUNDING TO EU FUNDING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AGREED 
PROPORTIONALITY;

N WE WILL SEEK TO NEGOTIATE, IF NECESSARY ON A REGIONAL BASIS, CONTINUING EU 
FUNDING AFTER THE YEAR 2000 TO SUPPORT OUR ROADS PROGRAMME. WE WILL ALSO SEEK 
CONTINUED EU FUNDING FOR THOSE ROADS THAT ARE PART OF OUR TRANS-EUROPEAN 
NETWORKS; 


N WE ARE OPEN TO INFRASTRUCTURAL PROJECTS BEING ENTIRELY FINANCED BY THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR TO THE SPECIFICATIONS OF THE NATIONAL ROADS AUTHORITY;

N WE WILL NOT INTRODUCE TOLLS ON ROADS JOINTLY FUNDED BY THE TAXPAYER AND THE 
EU, SUCH AS THE DUBLIN RING ROAD OR THE LEE TUNNEL.  TOLLS ON ROADS IN THE 
IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF CITIES DEFEAT THE 
PURPOSE OF RELIEVING CONGESTION.

N FUNDING FOR COUNTY ROADS WILL BE INCREASED EACH YEAR OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS 
TO ACCELERATE THE CURRENT 10-YEAR PROGRAMME. A SCHEME WILL BE PUT IN PLACE TO 
ENCOURAGE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO INCREASE THEIR INPUT INTO COUNTY ROADS FROM ÒOWN 
RESOURCESÓ.

FOLLOWING NEW APPROACHES 
IN ENERGY

FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL

ENCOURAGE EXPLORATION FOR OIL, EXPLOITING NEW TECHNOLOGY.

MANAGE EU-DRIVEN CHANGE IN THE ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY IN A WAY WHICH BEST MEETS 
IRELANDIS NEEDS.
  
EXTEND NATURAL GAS TO NEW CUSTOMERS.

EXTEND PEAT PRODUCTION FOR POWER GENERATION.

AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF RENEWABLE ENERGY.

CONSERVE ENERGY RIGHT ACROSS THE ECONOMY.
 
 
ENSURING THE COUNTRYIS ENERGY SUPPLIES

N OIL. WE WILL ACTIVELY ENCOURAGE OIL EXPLORATION THROUGH NEW INCENTIVES FOR USE 
OF MODERN EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGY.  WE WILL SEEK TO MAXIMISE THE BENEFITS TO THE 
IRISH ECONOMY OF ANY OIL FINDS, INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF IRISH WORKERS WORKING ON 
OIL RIGS AND THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS.

N MINING. WE WILL ADOPT A PRO-ACTIVE MINERALS POLICY, TO MAXIMISE THE 
CONTRIBUTION THE MINERALS INDUSTRY CAN MAKE TO THE NATIONAL ECONOMY AND 
EMPLOYMENT WHILE ENSURING THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION, HEALTH AND SAFETY, IN CONSULTATION WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES.WE WILL 
ACTIVELY PROMOTE MINERALS DEVELOPMENT, SUBJECT TO THESE REQUIREMENTS, UNDER A 
CLEAR LEGAL AND FISCAL RŽGIME.

N ELECTRICITY. FIANNA F‡IL WILL MANAGE THE EU REQUIREMENT FOR CHANGES IN 
THE ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY IN A WAY THAT BEST MEETS IRELANDIS NEEDS. IN CHOOSING 
NEW STRUCTURES FOR THE INDUSTRY WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE RELIABILITY OF THE 
NATIONIS ELECTRICITY SUPPLY IS RETAINED AND THE INTERESTS OF ALL ELECTRICITY 
CUSTOMERS ARE PROTECTED. 


GAS. WE WILL REVIEW THIRD PARTY ACCESS TO THE GAS INTERCONNECTOR, ON WHICH BORD 
G‡IS CURRENTLY HAS A VIRTUAL MONOPOLY. WE WILL AIM TO EXTEND NATURAL GAS AS FAR 
AS PRACTICABLE, TO ALL MAJOR TOWNS AND CITIES, INCLUDING GALWAY AND SLIGO.

N PEAT. WE WILL SUPPORT THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF BORD NA M-NA, AND WILL FAST-
TRACK THE MAJOR NEW PEAT STATION IN THE MIDLANDS. WE WILL UPGRADE THE 
BELLACORICK PEAT STATION, SO AS TO PROLONG ITS NATURAL LIFE.

N ALTERNATIVE SOURCES. WE WILL VIGOROUSLY PROMOTE RENEWABLE ENERGY 
PROJECTS, WHILE CONTINUING OUR OPPOSITION TO NUCLEAR POWER.
  
TAKING ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SERIOUSLY

FIANNA F‡IL WILL STRONGLY ENCOURAGE ENERGY PRODUCTION FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES, OR 
SOURCES WHICH OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY OF REDUCING LANDFILL. 

WE WILL CARRY OUT RESEARCH INTO NEW ENERGY SOURCES, AND PUBLISH A GREEN PAPER 
THAT WILL CONSIDER ALL SUCH SOURCES THAT ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE. WE 
WILL THEN DEVELOP A REALISTIC PLAN FOR THE USE OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY. THIS WILL 
INCLUDE TARGETS FOR THE FUTURE GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY 
SOURCES, AND FOR THE REDUCTION OF NON-RENEWABLE RESOURCES IN ELECTRICITY 
GENERATION.
       
 WE WILL CREATE INCENTIVES FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO PRODUCE ENERGY FROM 
ALTERNATIVE SOURCES, AND GIVE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR PILOT PROJECTS. TAXES AND 
SUBSIDIES WILL BE USED TO DIFFERENTIATE IN FAVOUR OF RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION  
FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRST-TIME HOUSE BUYERIS GRANT WILL BE WORTH MORE FOR HOUSES 
THAT USE SOLAR HEATING.

 WE WILL BRING IN A SCHEME TO DEVELOP SMALL-SCALE ELECTRICITY GENERATION 
PROJECTS BASED ON RENEWABLE ENERGY, AND ALLOW ACCESS TO THE ELECTRICITY NETWORK 
FOR GENERATORS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY WHO WISH TO SELL ÔGREENI ELECTRICITY TO 
CONSUMERS.

BIOMASS. WE WILL PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO HELPING THIS TECHNOLOGY BE 
DEMONSTRATED IN BOTH LARGE AND SMALL ENERGY CROP PROJECTS, AND TO HELPING SMALL-
SCALE PROJECTS SELL DIRECTLY INTO THE RETAIL ENERGY MARKET.

WIND ENERGY. WE WILL USE A COMBINATION OF TAX CONCESSIONS, PREMIUM BUY-BACK 
RATES AND SUBSIDIES TO STIMULATE THE MARKET FOR WIND ENERGY. WE WILL INVITE 
TENDERS FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN AREAS WITH HIGH AVERAGE WIND SPEEDS FOR A WIND 
ENERGY PARK WE WILL LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITY OF GIVING HOUSEHOLDS NEAR A WIND 
FARM A COMPENSATORY SUBSIDY TO REDUCE THEIR ELECTRICITY BILLS.
       
ENERGY FROM WASTE. WE WILL CAREFULLY EXAMINE 
THE POSSIBILITY OF GREATLY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF HOUSEHOLD WASTE GOING TO 
LANDFILL SITES BY PRODUCING COMBINED HEAT AND POWER FROM THE WASTE. THE 
POTENTIAL SAVING IN LANDFILL IS UP TO 50%.

SAVING ENERGY RIGHT ACROSS THE ECONOMY

 WE WILL SET STRICT TARGETS FOR ENERGY REDUCTION WITHIN ALL PUBLIC SECTOR 
ORGANISATIONS. ALL PUBLIC SECTOR BODIES WILL HAVE AN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT 
SYSTEM, INCLUDING TARGETS FOR THE REDUCTION OF ENERGY. 

 WE WILL CONSULT WITH EACH SECTOR OF INDUSTRY AND THEN DRAW UP SECTORAL PLANS 
FOR ENERGY REDUCTION. THESE WILL HAVE SPECIFIC TARGETS, AND PERFORMANCE WILL BE 
CLOSELY MONITORED.  WE WILL PROMOTE MORE VIGOROUSLY ENERGY AUDITS AND VOLUNTARY 
ARRANGEMENTS WITH INDUSTRY.

WE WILL IMPLEMENT A NATIONWIDE ENERGY-AWARENESS PROGRAMME, INCLUDING SCHOOLS, 
COLLEGES, LOCAL AUTHORITIES, AND COMMUNITY GROUPS. WE WILL PROMOTE PRODUCTS THAT 
USE LESS ENERGY OR HELP CONSERVE IT THROUGH AN IRISH ECO-LABELLING SCHEME. 
INFORMATION FOR CONSUMERS ON THE COST OF FUEL CONSUMPTION FOR VEHICLES OVER THE 
LIFETIME OF A VEHICLE WILL BE SUPPLIED BY PRODUCERS AND SALES OUTLETS. IN 
DESIGNATED AREAS, TAX BREAKS ON PROPERTIES WILL BE TIED TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY. 

AS PART OF A NATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR DOMESTIC ENERGY CONSERVATION, WE WILL SET UP 
A NATIONAL ENERGY TRUST. THIS WILL ADVISE SUPPLIERS AND CONSUMERS ON ENERGY 
CONSERVATION, AND WILL INITIATE RESEARCH AND PILOT ACTIONS. WE WILL BRING IN FAR 
STRICTER BUILDING REGULATIONS, COVERING INSULATION AND OTHER ENERGY SAVING 
MEASURES, AND DEVELOP A ÔGREENI BUILDING RATING FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY.FOR FIRST-
TIME BUYERS, WE WILL POSITIVELY DISCRIMINATE GRANTS IN FAVOUR OF HOUSING WITH 
HIGHER EFFICIENCY RATINGS.

FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL

GRASP THE HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY THE INFORMATION AGE OFFERS US

REVERSE THE NEGLECT OF THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT ON THIS KEY ISSUE

MAKE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AN EDUCATION PRIORITY, WITH EVERY STUDENT COMPUTER-
LITERATE

PUT IN PLACE A 5-YEAR PLAN TO BRING COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET TO EVERY 
CLASSROOM

RESTORE THE MOMENTUM NECESSARY TO PUT IRELAND IN THE TOP QUARTER OF DEVELOPED 
COUNTRIES FOR TELECOMS PERFORMANCE

REVISIT TELECOM ŽIREANNIS STRATEGIC ALLIANCE DEAL, TO GET A BETTER RESULT FOR 
THE NATIONAL INTEREST
 

GRASPING AN HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY

FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE THAT THE INFORMATION AGE OFFERS IRELAND A MASSIVE 
OPPORTUNITY-  ONE THAT, IF WE GRASP IT PROPERLY, CAN GREATLY ENHANCE THE 
ECONOMIC FUTURE OF EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY.  THE REASON IS THAT THE NEW AGE 
OFFERS US, FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, A WAY AROUND THE 
DISADVANTAGES WE HAVE ALWAYS SUFFERED BECAUSE OF OUR REMOTE POSITION ON THE 
PERIPHERY OF EUROPE.

IN THE INFORMATION AGE, WHERE WE ARE WILL NO LONGER MATTER. IRELAND WILL BE AS 
WELL-PLACED AS ANY COUNTRY IN A TRULY GLOBAL MARKET-PLACE, IF WE HAVE THE RIGHT 
INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. INDEED, BECAUSE OF THE CALIBRE OF OUR PEOPLE, IRELAND 
IS IDEALLY POSITIONED TO BECOME A LEADER IN A WORLD THAT WILL BE DOMINATED BY 
KNOWLEDGE INDUSTRIES.

HOWEVER, THIS OPPORTUNITY MUST BE GRASPED - THE DIVIDEND FROM THE INFORMATION 
AGE WILL NOT COME TO US AUTOMATICALLY.  ON THE CONTRARY: IF WE DO NOT PREPARE 
PROPERLY, WE WILL BE LEFT BEHIND. IF WE FAIL TO MEET THE CHALLENGE, THE 
INFORMATION AGE COULD UNDERMINE MUCH OF THE ECONOMIC SUCCESS WE HAVE ENJOYED SO 
FAR.
       

 WE MUST READY OURSELVES FOR THE NEW ERA IN TWO MAIN WAYS. FIRST, THROUGH THE 
EDUCATION SYSTEM,  PREPARING OUR PEOPLE FOR A TOTALLY NEW WAY OF DOING THINGS. 
SECOND, THROUGH OUR COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE, MAKING SURE THAT OUR PEOPLE 
HAVE FULL, LOW-COST ACCESS TO THE TOOLS THAT MAKE THE NEW WAYS 
POSSIBLE.

IN BOTH THESE CRITICAL SECTORS, WE ARE ALREADY BEHIND. IN BOTH THESE AREAS THE 
RAINBOW GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND. A RECENT SURVEY SHOWED 
IRELAND TO BE, NOT IN THE VANGUARD OF INFORMATION AGE READINESS WHERE WE COULD 
AND SHOULD BE, BUT IN THE THIRD DIVISION OF COUNTRIES.

EDUCATING FOR A NEW AGE

IN FIANNA F‡ILIS EDUCATION GREEN PAPER OF 1992, WE CLEARLY SIGNALLED THE COMING 
SIGNIFICANCE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION.  

FIANNA F‡ILIS POLICY DOCUMENT ON INFORMATION  TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION, PUBLISHED 
EARLIER THIS YEAR, LED THE WAY IN PROPOSING A RADICAL NEW DEPARTURE. SINCE THEN 
THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT HAS ISSUED ITS OWN 5-YEAR PROGRAMME. WHERE APPROPRIATE OR 
WORTHWHILE, FIANNA F‡IL WILL INCORPORATE ELEMENTS OF THAT PROGRAMME INTO OUR OWN 
MUCH MORE WIDE-RANGING POLICY.

WE WILL MAKE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AN EDUCATION PRIORITY.

FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL ENSURE THAT EVERY YOUNG PERSON IS COMPUTER 
LITERATE BY THE END OF THEIR SCHOOL CAREER.  WE WILL MAKE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 
A FULLY INTEGRATED AND FULLY AVAILABLE COMPONENT OF THE IRISH EDUCATION SYSTEM.

WE WILL PUT IN PLACE A 5-YEAR PROGRAMME OF RESEARCH BETWEEN THIRD-LEVEL COLLEGES 
AND BUSINESS. 

WE WILL ESTABLISH A NEW BODY COMBINING THE HEA, THIRD-LEVEL INSTITUTIONS, IDA, 
FORBAIRT, FORF‡S AND IBEC TO CO-ORDINATE NATIONAL UP-SKILLING IN NEW 
TECHNOLOGIES.

WE WILL CONSIDER SETTING UP A SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION FORUM, TO 
PROMOTE IRELAND AS A CENTRE OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL EXCELLENCE.
  




TOWARDS COMPUTER LITERACY IN FIVE YEARS

FIANNA F‡IL WILL PUT IN PLACE A 5-YEAR PLAN, AT 
THE END OF WHICH EVERY CLASSROOM IN THE COUNTRY WILL HAVE A MULTIMEDIA COMPUTER, 
WITH DIRECT ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. 

WITHIN TWO YEARS, EVERY SCHOOL WILL HAVE THAT ACCESS.  THIS WILL APPLY TO 
PRIMARY SCHOOLS AS WELL AS SECONDARY, SINCE WE BELIEVE THAT COMPUTER LITERACY 
MUST BEGIN EARLY.

ELEMENTS OF FIANNA F‡ILIS INFORMATION AGE PLAN:

WE WILL PROVIDE 100% FUNDING TO GET INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INTO SCHOOLS IN 
DISADVANTAGED AREAS. THIS IS CRITICAL TO AVOID OPENING UP A NEW FIELD OF 
DISADVANTAGE,  SINCE STUDENTS IN THESE SCHOOLS RARELY HAVE ACCESS TO A 
COMPUTER AT HOME.

WE WILL MAKE A SPECIAL DEAL WITH TELECOM ŽIREANN FOR SEPARATE PHONE LINES AND 
LOW-COST INTERNET ACCESS TO SCHOOLS.

WE WILL GIVE AN ANNUAL BUDGET TO EACH SCHOOL, FOR COMPUTER MAINTENANCE AND 
RUNNING COSTS.

WE WILL PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE IN-CAREER TRAINING PROGRAMMES FOR TEACHERS, SO 
THEY CAN NOT ONLY USE COMPUTERS EFFECTIVELY BUT ALSO CAN INTEGRATE THE 
TECHNOLOGY FULLY INTO THEIR TEACHING IN EVERY CURRICULUM AREA. ALL TRAINING FOR 
NEW TEACHERS WILL GIVE A HIGH PRIORITY TO USING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN 
TEACHING.

WE WILL CREATE A DYNAMIC PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE 
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, TO ACCELERATE ACCESS BY SCHOOLS TO THE INFORMATION AGE. 
IT IS IN THE LONG-TERM INTEREST OF MANY COMPANIES THAT IRELAND HAS A FULLY 
COMPUTER-LITERATE POPULATION, AND WE WILL LEVERAGE THIS FACT TO SPEED UP THE 
PROCESS. WE WILL SET UP A NATIONAL SYSTEM TO DISTRIBUTE USED COMPUTERS FROM THE 
PRIVATE SECTOR TO SCHOOLS, AND UPGRADE THE ROLE OF THE NATIONAL INFORMATION 
TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION CENTRE IN PROMOTING IT IN SCHOOLS.

WE WILL ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF IRISH-CREATED EDUCATION 
SOFTWARE, FOR BOTH HOME AND OVERSEAS MARKETS.

WE WILL STIMULATE THE FULL USE OF INTERNET-BASED EDUCATION PROJECTS.
  

CREATING THE RIGHT TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE
   
THE KEY FACT ABOUT THE INFORMATION AGE IS THAT 
IT IS CONNECTED. WITHOUT THE MEANS TO COMMUNICATE INSTANTLY AND COST-
EFFECTIVELY, OUR HUMAN RESOURCES ARE POWERLESS.

FOR THIS REASON, FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE IT IS A VITAL NATIONAL INTEREST THAT 
IRELAND HAS A STATE-OF-THE-ART COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT PROVIDES US 
WITH HIGH-QUALITY GLOBAL ACCESS AT KEENLY COMPETITIVE RATES. 

TO REACH OUR OBJECTIVES, IRELAND NEEDS TO BE IN THE TOP QUARTER OF DEVELOPED 
COUNTRIES FOR ALL THE RECOGNISED SERVICE MEASURES. BUT IN FACT, A RECENT OECD 
ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT IRELAND IS IN THE TOP QUARTER FOR ONLY TWO OUT OF 13 
MEASURES. IT IS IN THE BOTTOM QUARTER FOR FOUR OF THE MEASURES, AND IN THE 
BOTTOM HALF FOR SEVEN OUT OF THE 13.

WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO, AND UNDER THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT PROGRESS IN THIS 
VITAL SECTOR HAS STAGNATED. 

IRELAND WAS THE LAST EU COUNTRY TO INTRODUCE COMPETITION IN MOBILE PHONES.

A PROPER INDEPENDENT REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IS STILL NOT IN PLACE.

TELECOM ŽIREANNIS STRATEGIC ALLIANCE HAS SUFFERED GRIEVOUSLY FROM 
PREVARICATION AND DELAY. 

TELECOMMUNICATIONS COSTS ARE STILL FAR TOO HIGH, MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR 
IRISH BUSINESS TO COMPETE.

WHERE THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT FAILED, FIANNA F‡IL WILL RESTORE THE
MOMENTUM.
  
FORGING THE RIGHT STRATEGIC FUTURE FOR TELECOM ŽIREANN

THE FUTURE OF TELECOM ŽIREANN IS CENTRAL TO THE FUTURE OF TELECOMS IN IRELAND, 
EVEN IN A FULLY COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE. IT IS THEREFORE VITAL THAT ITS STRATEGY 
FOR THE FUTURE IS THE BEST FOR THE COMPANY AND FOR THE NATIONAL INTEREST. 
UNFORTUNATELY, THE WAY IN WHICH TELECOM ŽIREANN ACQUIRED A STRATEGIC PARTNER IS 
QUITE UNSATISFACTORY, AND FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL REVISIT IT.



THERE ARE FOUR MAIN ISSUES:

THE PRICE PAID BY THE NEW PARTNERS FOR THEIR STAKE IN TELECOM ŽIREANN. ONLY £183 
MILLION HAS BEEN PAID FOR A 20% STAKE, WHEREAS ONLY FOUR YEARS AGO £500 MILLION 
COULD HAVE BEEN RAISED FOR THE SALE OF A MINORITY STAKE.

THE SECRECY SURROUNDING THE DEAL. THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT HAVE STUBBORNLY REFUSED 
TO DIVULGE THE TERMS OF THE DEAL OR THE CONDITIONS ATTACHING TO IT. FIANNA F‡IL 
BELIEVE THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE FOR THE SALE OF SUCH AN IMPORTANT 
NATIONAL ASSET. THE SECRECY GIVES RISE TO SUSPICIONS ABOUT WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN 
CONCEDED TO THE INCOMING INVESTORS.

THE FEAR THAT THE DEAL MAY BE STRUCTURED TO ENCOURAGE A QUICK INVESTMENT PROFIT, 
RATHER THAN THE FULLEST DEVELOPMENT OF A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE RESOURCE.  THIS 
MAKES IT ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE TERMS WERE.

THE REPRESENTATION OF WORKER DIRECTORS ON THE TELECOM ŽIREANN BOARD, AND THE 
QUESTION OF ADEQUATE EMPLOYEE SHAREHOLDING. THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT HAVE REDUCED 
THE NUMBER OF THE EMPLOYEESI VOTING DIRECTORS,AND HAVE OFFERED A 5% SHAREHOLDING 
INSTEAD OF THE 15% THE EMPLOYEES ARE PREPARED TO PAY FOR.

FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL PUBLISH THE TERMS OF TELECOM ŽIREANNIS STRATEGIC 
ALLIANCE DEAL WITH KPN AND TELIA, SUBJECT ONLY TO THE GENUINE REQUIREMENTS OF 
COMMERCIAL CONFIDENTIALITY. 

FOLLOWING PUBLICATION OF THE DETAILS WE WILL CARRY OUT AN URGENT RE-EXAMINATION 
OF THE DEAL, WITH A VIEW TO GETTING A BETTER RESULT FOR THE TAXPAYER.  WE WILL 
NEGOTIATE A STRONGER DEAL THAT IS OF GREATER STRATEGIC BENEFIT TO THE COMPANY 
AND TO THE IRISH NATION.

WE WILL MAINTAIN THE NUMBER OF WORKER DIRECTORS ON THE TELECOM BOARD AT FOUR. WE 
WILL RESERVE FOR THE TELECOM WORKFORCE THE RIGHT TO BUY A STAKE OF UP 
TO 15% IN THE COMPANY AT A FAIR PRICE.

 WITH A VIEW TO REFOCUSING THE COMPANYIS ENERGY ON ITS ROLE IN LEADING IRELAND 
INTO THE INFORMATION AGE, FIANNA F‡IL WILL

INITIATE IMMEDIATELY FULL-SCALE PREPARATIONS TO ENABLE THE COMPANY TO COMPETE 
EFFECTIVELY WHEN THE DEROGATION FROM FULL COMPETITION IS REMOVED AT THE END OF 
1999.



UNDERTAKE AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF THE FEASIBILITY OF SETTING UP A SINGLE 
CHARGING RATE FOR CALLS MADE TO ANYWHERE ON THE ISLAND OF IRELAND. WE BELIEVE 
THAT SUCH A UNIFORM RATE WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS BOOST TO BUSINESS 
COMPETITIVENESS, AND ENCOURAGE FIRMS OF ALL SIZES TO GEAR THEMSELVES UP FOR THE 
NEW WAY OF DOING BUSINESS.

REWARDING THE RISK-TAKERS 


FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION ON SIX LONG-TERM INDUSTRIAL 
POLICY ISSUES

SUPPORTING INDUSTRY THROUGH BETTER LONG-TERM PLANNING

ENCOURAGE ENTREPRENEURSHIP THROUGH THE TAX SYSTEM

STREAMLINE THE STATEIS INTERFACE WITH BUSINESS

GIVE THE SAME PRIORITY TO SUSTAINING JOBS AS TO CREATING THEM

MAKE LIFE EASIER FOR THE SMALLER BUSINESS

DOUBLE OUR NATIONAL INVESTMENT IN TRAINING WITHIN FIVE YEARS
 
 
SUPPORTING INDUSTRY THROUGH BETTER LONG-TERM PLANNING

IN OUR FIRST YEAR IN GOVERNMENT, FIANNA F‡IL WILL ADDRESS DECISIVELY THESE SIX 
KEY LONG-TERM ISSUES:

WE WILL CREATE AN ACTION PLAN TO IMPLEMENT THE IMPORTANT FORF‡S REPORT, SHAPING 
OUR FUTURE.

WE WILL SET UP A NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS COUNCIL, TO PROVIDE A 
PERMANENT WATCHDOG ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE FOR THE IRISH ECONOMY.  THE COUNCIL, 
WHICH WILL INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SOCIAL PARTNERS, WILL ASSESS THE 
IMPLICATIONS OF FUTURE EU DIRECTIVES AND ADVISE ON IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULES FOR 
THE CURRENT BACKLOG OF DIRECTIVES.

WE WILL SET UP A COMMISSION TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH THE LIKELY 
CONTRACTION OF EU FUNDS FOR TRAINING, ENTERPRISE AND INFRASTRUCTURE AFTER 1999.

WE WILL PUT IN PLACE A STRATEGY TO FOLLOW THE EXPIRY OF THE 10% RATE OF 
CORPORATION PROFITS TAX IN 2010 (2005 FOR SHANNON AND THE IFSC). FIANNA F‡ILIS 
LONG-TERM AIM IS TO REDUCE CORPORATION TAX FOR ALL COMPANIES TO 10% BY 2010. ON 
THIS BASIS WE WILL MAKE A CASE TO THE EU TO CANCEL THE 
PRESENT EXPIRY DATES.
WE WILL COMPREHENSIVELY REVAMP INDUSTRIAL POLICY, TO ENCOURAGE A BETTER SPREAD 
OF INWARD INVESTMENT PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY; MORE LOCATION HERE BY 
OVERSEAS 
COMPANIES OF KEY BUSINESS FUNCTIONS SUCH AS 
MARKETING, RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DESIGN; DEEPER 
LINKAGES BETWEEN IRISH FIRMS AND MULTINATIONALS; AND GREATER EXPLOITATION OF 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR IRISH FIRMS IN PUBLIC PROCUREMENT ACROSS THE EU.

WE WILL SET UP A FORUM TO HARNESS THE ADVICE, SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE OF THE VERY 
HIGH NUMBER OF IRISH SCIENTISTS AND TECHNOLOGISTS ABROAD AS WE 
REPOSITION IRELAND FOR THE INFORMATION AGE.

ENCOURAGING ENTERPRISE THROUGH THE TAX SYSTEM

WE WILL ESTABLISH A NEW ÒE-CLASSÓ OF COMPANY SHARES, TO FREE UP THE LATENT 
ENTREPRENEURSHIP OF EMPLOYEES. THIS WILL MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE TO VEST A HIGH 
PROPORTION OF THE FUTURE VALUE OF A BUSINESS IN ITS EMPLOYEES. FOR THOSE 
EMPLOYEES IT WILL CREATE A TAX-FREE INCOME STREAM AND GROWTH IN UNDERLYING 
CAPITAL VALUES, WHILE PROTECTING CONTROL AND OWNERSHIP BY THE BUSINESS OWNER.

WE WILL REWARD BUSINESS OWNERS WHO TAKE RISKS AND CREATE SUSTAINED EMPLOYMENT, 
WITH A REDUCTION IN THEIR PERSONAL INCOME TAX RELATED DIRECTLY TO THE PROPORTION 
OF EXTRA EMPLOYMENT THEY CREATE.

WE WILL COMPLETELY OVERHAUL THE TAX REFUND SEED CAPITAL SCHEME TO ENSURE THAT IT 
WORKS. THIS ADVENTUROUS SCHEME WAS CREATED TO ENCOURAGE SENIOR EMPLOYEES TO 
START UP THEIR OWN ENTERPRISE, WITH SEED CAPITAL PROVIDED THROUGH A REFUND OF 
INCOME TAXES PAID BY THEM WHILE IN EMPLOYMENT. THE SCHEME IS AN ALMOST TOTAL 
FAILURE DUE TO ITS CUMBERSOME RULES AND 
ADMINISTRATION. 

WE WILL GIVE PROPRIETARY DIRECTORS OF COMPANIES A PAYE ALLOWANCE, PUTTING THEM 
ON A PAR WITH EVERYONE ELSE.

WE WILL CHANGE THE TAX RŽGIME ON SUCCESSION IN FAMILY BUSINESSES, WITH ROLLOVER 
RELIEF WHERE THE BENEFICIARY IS A FULL-TIME PARTICIPANT AND HAS
 COMPLETED A RELEVANT EDUCATION COURSE.







FIANNA F‡IL WILL AIM TOWARDS A SITUATION WHERE PROFITS UNDER £100,000 ARE TAXED 
AT 25%, AND PROFITS BETWEEN £100,000 AND £250,000 ARE TAXED AT  30%.  WE WILL 
AIM TO BRING IN A 10% TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST £50,000 OF PROFITS OF SERVICE 
FIRMS. (AT PRESENT THE FIRST £50,000 OF COMPANY PROFITS ARE TAXED AT 28%, THE 
REST AT 36%.)

WE WILL FURTHER REDUCE EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE PRSI (OR LEVIES) TO IMPROVE 
COMPETITIVENESS. WE WILL FUND THESE REDUCTIONS PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE BUOYANCY 
IN THE SOCIAL INSURANCE FUND RESULTING FROM INCREASED 
EMPLOYMENT.
 
STREAMLINING THE STATEIS INTERFACE WITH BUSINESS

AT PRESENT, THERE ARE MORE THAN 150 DIFFERENT AGENCIES DEALING WITH ENTERPRISE, 
ESPECIALLY SMALL AND NEW START-UP BUSINESSES. GRANT AID FOR RURAL AND URBAN 
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS CAN COME FROM AS MANY AS 50 DIFFERENT FUNDS. 

 THIS JIGSAW-PUZZLE OF AGENCIES AND FUNDS CAUSES ENORMOUS CONFUSION FOR 
ENTREPRENEURS AND WASTES THEIR TIME. 

TO END THE CHAOS, FIANNA F‡IL WILL SET UP A ONE-STOP-ENTERPRISE SHOP IN EACH 
COUNTY, PROVIDING A SINGLE GATEWAY TO EVERY STATE PROGRAMME AND GRANT AID. 

 WE WILL DO THIS THROUGH AN EXISTING STRUCTURE, PROBABLY THE COUNTY ENTERPRISE 
BOARDS.
AT NATIONAL LEVEL, WE BELIEVE THERE MUST BE RATIONALISATION OF THE NUMBER OF 
AGENCIES. TO AVOID THE MISTAKES OF HASTY, ILL-PREPARED MERGERS OF THE PAST, WE 
WILL PLAN THIS CAREFULLY: WE WILL ESTABLISH COMMON GROUND BETWEEN THE VARIOUS 
BODIES AS A PRELUDE TO 
AMALGAMATION, AND ENTER INTO FULL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SOCIAL PARTNERS BEFORE 
ANY FINAL DECISIONS ARE TAKEN ON RATIONALISATION.

OUR AIM IS TO ESTABLISH A SINGLE AGENCY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND SERVICES, TO 
REPLACE ALL THE EXISTING STRUCTURES SUPPORTING THIS SECTOR. AT GOVERNMENT LEVEL, 
WE WILL ALSO STREAMLINE THE INTERFACE WITH BUSINESS. AS MANY AS EIGHT MINISTERS 
AND MINISTERS OF STATE HAVE RESPONSIBILITY AT PRESENT FOR ENTERPRISE/BUSINESS 
AND EMPLOYMENT MATTERS. 

WE WILL BRING TRADE INTO THE ENTERPRISE AND EMPLOYMENT PORTFOLIO. TRAINING AND 
SMALL BUSINESS WILL HAVE A BIG EMPHASIS IN A REVAMPED ENTERPRISE DEPARTMENT.
WE WILL SET UP TWO POLICY UNITS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF ENTERPRISE AND EMPLOYMENT, 
ONE FOR SMALL BUSINESS AND ONE FOR BIG BUSINESS. FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY, WE 
WILL REQUIRE THE IDA AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL PROMOTION AGENCIES TO APPEAR BEFORE 
OIREACHTAS COMMITTEES.

WE WILL PUT IN PLACE A CLEAR POLICY FOR MANAGING THE EXIT OF THE STATEIS 
INVESTMENT FROM FIRMS. (FORBAIRT CURRENTLY HOLDS SHARES IN 445 COMPANIES, 
REPRESENTING A £65 MILLION INVESTMENT.)

GIVING HIGHER PRIORITY TO SUSTAINING JOBS

FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE IT IS AS IMPORTANT TO SUSTAIN THE JOBS WE HAVE AS IT IS TO 
CREATE NEW ONES. 

LAST YEAR, 13,180 NEW JOBS WERE CREATED BY IDA IRELAND, BUT 6,000 EXISTING JOBS 
WERE LOST. 

FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE THAT THROUGH PROMPT, EFFECTIVE ACTION MANY JOBS UNDER THREAT 
COULD BE SAVED.

WE WILL UPGRADE THE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM AND THE EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION UNIT TO 
DETECT DIFFICULTIES AT COMPANIES. 

WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE IDA WORKS SYSTEMATICALLY WITH VULNERABLE INDUSTRIES TO 
IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE IRISH FACILITY. 

IN THE EVENT OF CLOSURE, WE WILL INSIST THAT THE IDA IMMEDIATELY GIVES 
PRIORITY TO PROMOTE THE FACILITY AND WORKFORCE FOR ALTERNATIVE INDUSTRY. IN EACH 
CASE, WE WILL SET UP SPECIAL TASK FORCES TO GIVE TARGETED RETRAINING TO THE 
WORKFORCE AND GEAR THEIR SKILLS FOR NEW JOB OPPORTUNITIES.
  
MAKING LIFE EASIER FOR SMALLER BUSINESSES


WE WILL MAKE MORE ACCESSIBLE THE SOFT-LOAN SCHEMES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES, BY 
LOWERING THE MINIMUM LOAN THRESHOLD TO £10,000 (FROM THE CURRENT £20,000). 

WE WILL, ON REQUEST, GIVE FEEDBACK TO SMALL AND MEDIUM FIRMS TENDERING FOR 
PUBLIC SECTOR CONTRACTS IF THEIR BID IS NOT ACCEPTED. 

WE WILL REQUIRE FORBAIRT TO HAVE A CUSTOMERSI CHARTER, INCLUDING AN APPEALS 
PROCESS FOR COMPANIES REFUSED FUNDING.

WE WILL IMPLEMENT THE LAW THAT ALL STATE BODIES PAY THEIR BILLS ON TIME, AND 
REQUIRE ALL MAIN CONTRACTORS TO GOVERNMENT TO PAY THEIR SUB-CONTRACTORS 
PROMPTLY. 
  
WE WILL CONSIDER A SPECIAL COURT SYSTEM THAT WILL ALLOW FOR QUICK, INEXPENSIVE 
AND EFFECTIVE LEGAL REMEDIES FOR NON-PAYMENT OF COMMERCIAL DEBTS.

WE WILL PUT A STATUTORY OBLIGATION ON STATE BODIES TO MINIMISE THE AMOUNT OF 
PAPERWORK THAT HAS TO BE COMPLETED BY SMALL BUSINESSES AND THE PUBLIC.

WE WILL REDUCE THE FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR TARGETED SMALL AND 
MEDIUM ENTERPRISES, WHOSE CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE LITTLE FROM YEAR TO YEAR.

WE WILL HOLD AN ANNUAL TAOISEACHIS CONFERENCE ON SMALL BUSINESS, TO KEEP THIS 
VERY IMPORTANT SECTORIS CONCERNS AT THE TOP OF THE NATIONAL AGENDA.

UPGRADING TRAINING FOR A CHANGING WORKPLACE

TRAINING OUR PEOPLE FOR WORK AND IN WORK WILL BE OF EVEN GREATER IMPORTANCE AS 
THE PACE OF INDUSTRIAL CHANGE ACCELERATES. 

FIANNA F‡IL WILL IMPLEMENT AN URGENT STRATEGY TO UPGRADE OUR NATIONAL TRAINING 
IN ALL RESPECTS.

UNDER THIS STRATEGY, WE WILL AIM TO DOUBLE INVESTMENT IN TRAINING WITHIN FIVE 
YEARS. 

IRISH FIRMS CURRENTLY SPEND ONLY 1.2% OF ANNUAL TURNOVER ON TRAINING, COMPARED 
TO THE EU NORM OF BETWEEN 3% AND 5%.

AS PART OF THE NATIONAL TRAINING STRATEGY, WE WILL

PUBLISH DETAILED PROPOSALS ON TRAINING. THESE WILL EXAMINE THE FUTURE ROLE OF 
F‡S, AND WHETHER ITS INDUSTRIAL TRAINING FUNCTION SHOULD BE SEPARATED FROM ITS 
PROGRAMMES FOR UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE. 

CREATE A NEW SYSTEM OF NATIONALLY-CERTIFIED TRAINEESHIPS, FOCUSED AT THOSE GOING 
DIRECTLY FROM SCHOOL INTO THE WORKFORCE.  THEY WILL HAVE A BROADER SCOPE THAN 
THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF APPRENTICESHIPS AND COVER A WIDER RANGE OF OCCUPATIONS. 
THEY WILL INVOLVE BOTH ON AND OFF-THE-JOB TRAINING. WE WILL CONSULT WITH 
EMPLOYERS AND TRADE UNIONS ON THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SCHEME. 

EXTEND TAX RELIEF FOR TRAINING TO INDIVIDUALS. IT CURRENTLY IS RESTRICTED TO 
COMPANIES. 

CREATING A COMPETITIVE TOURISM INDUSTRY FOR THE 
21ST CENTURY

FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL

CHART A NEW STRATEGIC DIRECTION FOR IRISH TOURISM, AFTER THE CURRENT INVESTMENT 
PROGRAMME

GUARANTEE ADEQUATE INVESTMENT IN TOURISM FACILITIES AND IN MARKETING

ADDRESS RECRUITMENT AND TRAINING DEFICIENCIES WHICH THREATEN GROWTH

PROTECT OUR TOURISTS FROM CRIMINALS

ACCELERATE THE GROWTH OF RURAL TOURISM

PRESERVE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR TOURISM
 
 
SETTING A NEW STRATEGIC DIRECTION

THE URGENT CHALLENGE FACING TOURISM IS WHAT STRATEGIES TO FOLLOW AFTER 1999, 
WHEN THE INTENSIVE INVESTMENT SUPPORTED BY EU STRUCTURAL FUNDS WILL END. GETTING 
THE ANSWERS RIGHT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE: BY THE END OF 
THE DECADE THERE WILL BE 200,000 PEOPLE WORKING IN TOURISM AND THE SECTOR WILL 
BE GENERATING ANNUAL REVENUES OF £2.25 BILLION.
       
 WE WILL SPEEDILY AGREE WITH THE INDUSTRY NEW OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR 
TOURISM UP TO THE YEAR 2005. THE OBJECTIVES WILL INCLUDE A TARGET FOR THE 
PERCENTAGE OF GNP WHICH THE SECTOR WILL CONTRIBUTE, AND TARGETS FOR NEW JOB 
NUMBERS.

OUR STRATEGY WILL BE GEARED ABOVE ALL TO MAKING IRELAND AN ATTRACTIVE 
DESTINATION FOR TOMORROWIS TOURIST. 

IT WILL BE A PRIORITY TO MAKE TOURISM A YEAR-ROUND BUSINESS AND TO ENSURE A 
BETTER SPREAD OF TOURISM REVENUE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. 

WE WILL CONTINUE TO MARKET IRELAND AS A SINGLE DESTINATION IN CO-OPERATION WITH 
THE NORTHERN IRELAND TOURIST BOARD.
CONTINUING TO INVEST IN TOURISM 

THE NEED FOR CONSIDERABLE SPENDING ON TOURISM WILL REMAIN. THERE ARE TWO MAIN 
ISSUES: SPENDING BY BORD F‡ILTE, LARGELY ON ATTRACTING TOURISTS, AND INVESTMENT 
SPENDING WHICH EXTENDS AND RENEWS THE TOURISM PRODUCT. 

WE WILL CARRY OUT AN IMMEDIATE REVIEW OF BORD F‡ILTE SPENDING, WHICH HAS 
ACTUALLY FALLEN OVER THE PAST DECADE  DESPITE THE MUSHROOMING OF TOURISM NUMBERS 
AND REVENUE, AND A MUCH MORE COMPETITIVE WORLD MARKET. THIS REVIEW WILL SET A 
TARGET LEVEL OF SUPPORT FOR THE SECTOR UP TO THE YEAR 2000. 

WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN MEETING THE INDUSTRY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF 
INVESTMENT FUNDING FOR TOURISM AFTER 1999. FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL SET UP 
AN INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT GROUP TO PRODUCE SPEEDY 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND STRATEGIES. WE WILL CONSIDER TAX INCENTIVES FOR TOURISM-
RELATED PROJECTS AS PART OF THIS. WE WILL PUBLISH AN ANNUAL GUIDE TO SUPPORTS 
FOR THE TOURISM INDUSTRY. 

ATTRACTING AND TRAINING THE RIGHT PEOPLE 

CERT AND BORD F‡ILTE WILL WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER AND WITH THE INDUSTRY TO ADDRESS 
RECRUITMENT AND TRAINING DEFICIENCIES, WHICH NOW THREATEN THE SECTORIS GROWTH.

WE WILL BRING TOGETHER EMPLOYERS AND UNIONS TO DEVELOP A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR 
TRAINING, PAY AND CONDITIONS. 

WE WILL LOOK AT SETTING UP TRAINING SCHOOLS FOR THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY IN KEY 
LOCATIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY, OPERATING IN THE LOW SEASON BETWEEN NOVEMBER AND 
MARCH. 

WE WILL CREATE NEW TRAINING PROGRAMMES FOR TOURIST INFORMATION OFFICERS AND 
GUIDES.

ENSURING THAT TOURISTS ARE SAFE 

CRIME AGAINST TOURISTS UNDERMINES THE FUTURE OF THE INDUSTRY, AND WE WILL TARGET 
THIS SPECIFICALLY AS PART OF FIANNA F‡ILIS OVERALL WAR AGAINST CRIME. 

WE WILL FACILITATE THE PROSECUTION OF CRIMES AGAINST TOURISTS BY ALLOWING THE 
EVIDENCE OF VICTIMS TO BE TAKEN ON VIDEO IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY. 
  



WE WILL BRING IN EXEMPLARY PENALTIES FOR PERSONS WHO HABITUALLY PREY ON 
TOURISTS.

WE WILL INCREASE TELEVISION SURVEILLANCE BY THE GARDA' IN AREAS WITH HIGH 
TOURIST TRAFFIC.

N        WE WILL PROVIDE GARDA INFORMATION KIOSKS AT SIGNIFICANT TOURIST 
LOCATIONS.

MARKETING AND PRESENTING TOURISM FACILITIES

TO BRING IRISH TOURISM FULLY INTO THE INFORMATION AGE, FIANNA F‡IL WILL ENSURE 
THAT WE HAVE A NATIONAL TOURISM DATABASE THAT IS EFFICIENT, 
COST-EFFECTIVE AND USER-FRIENDLY. ACCESSIBLE WORLDWIDE, IT WILL HANDLE BOTH 
INFORMATION AND BOOKINGS.

AN OFFICIAL ANNUAL GUIDE FOR ACCOMMODATION AND RESTAURANTS WILL BE PRODUCED. 

WE WILL CREATE NEW NATIONAL STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR SIGNPOSTING. THIS 
WILL INCLUDE ALL GENERAL SIGNPOSTING AND SIGNPOSTING RELATED TO AREAS OF 
INTEREST TO VISITORS. WE WILL AIM TO ENHANCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINABLE 
TOURISM BY ATTRACTIVELY-PRESENTED EXPLANATIONS OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SITES TO 
VISITORS. 

INTERPRETATION WILL BE ENCOURAGED AS A MEANS TO ENHANCE THE TOURISM 
PRODUCT. INTERESTED PARTIES WILL BE URGED TO DEVISE INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE WAYS 
TO PROVIDE INTERPRETATION BESIDES VISITOR CENTRES. WE WILL IMPLEMENT THE BORD 
F‡ILTE PRINCIPLES ON VISITOR CENTRES, AND PROVIDE GUIDELINES TO 
RELEVANT BODIES TO SUPPORT THESE PRINCIPLES.
  
ACCELERATING THE GROWTH OF RURAL TOURISM

FIANNA F‡IL WILL ENCOURAGE COMMUNITY-LED RURAL TOURISM INITIATIVES. THEY WILL BE 
GIVEN THE EXPERTISE TO ADVISE THEM ON THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR 
AREAS. 

WE WILL ENCOURAGE FARMING ORGANISATIONS TO DISSEMINATE INFORMATION AMONG THEIR 
MEMBERS ON THE CULTURAL VALUE OF FIELD MONUMENTS, RING-FORTS AND OTHER 
ARCHAEOLOGICAL MONUMENTS. 

WE WILL CONSIDER A RURAL COTTAGE PROGRAMME SIMILAR TO THAT OPERATED BY THE 
NORTHERN IRELAND TOURISM BOARD: THIS COULD PROVIDE A SOURCE OF INCOME FOR 
FARMERS AND OTHERS LIVING IN RURAL AREAS, AND MIGHT ATTRACT EU 
FUNDING AS RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO FARMING. 
PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT 


UNDER FIANNA F‡IL, ALL TOURIST PROGRAMMES WILL HAVE A STRONG ENVIRONMENTAL 
DIMENSION. OUR TWIN AIM IS TO PRESERVE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE TOURIST, AND TO 
PRESERVE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE NATION.

WE WILL REVISE PLANNING LAWS TO ENSURE THAT INAPPROPRIATE VISITOR CENTRES OR 
BUILDINGS DO NOT INTERFERE WITH THE CHARACTER OF HERITAGE SITES.

TO DEVELOP MORE ATTRACTIVE CITIES AND TOWNS, WE WILL ENCOURAGE MORE 
PEDESTRIANISATION.

WE WILL ENCOURAGE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO BRING IN MORE STRINGENT DESIGN GUIDELINES 
FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE COUNTRYSIDE, AND TO NOMINATE AN ENVIRONMENT 
OFFICER TO MONITOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF 
DEVELOPMENTS.

THE CONCEPT OF THE CARRYING CAPACITY OF RURAL AREAS WILL BE INCLUDED IN TOURISM 
DEVELOPMENT PLANS, WHICH MAY USE ZONING TO FOCUS DEVELOPMENT IN RURAL AREAS. AS 
AN ALTERNATIVE TO GENERAL RIBBON DEVELOPMENT IN THE
COUNTRYSIDE, LOCAL AUTHORITIES WILL PROVIDE ATTRACTIVE SITES IN THE IMMEDIATE 
VICINITY OF TOWNS AND VILLAGES INTO WHICH DEMAND FOR SITES WILL BE 
CHANNELLED.

LOCAL AUTHORITIES WILL PROVIDE STATUTORY PROTECTION FOR HEDGEROWS. ADVICE ON 
HEDGEROW TRIMMING WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE, SO THAT IT MINIMISES THE ADVERSE 
EFFECTS ON WILDLIFE. 
 

   AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND FOOD
     DEVELOPING THE FULL POTENTIAL OF IRISH AGRICULTURE
 FIANNA FÁIL IN GOVERNMENT WILL
 ENSURE THAT AGRICULTURE, FOOD AND FORESTRY BECOMES A TOP POLITICAL PRIORITY
 REFOCUS THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ON ITS CENTRAL MISSION  DEVELOPING THE 
RIGHT POLICIES FOR IRISH AGRICULTURE
 REBUILD CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN IRISH FOOD THROUGH AN INDEPENDENT FOOD QUALITY 
AUTHORITY WITH FULL EXECUTIVE POWERS
 ENCOURAGE A TOTAL DEDICATION TO QUALITY, FROM PRODUCTION RIGHT THROUGH TO THE 
SUPERMARKET SHELF
 SUPPORT THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF FARM FAMILIES
 ENSURE THAT AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IS ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE
 CREATE AN INTEGRATED LAND USE POLICY THROUGH CONSULTATION
 DEVELOP A COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE SECTOR
 REFORM THE TAX REGIME FOR FARMERS
 STIMULATE RAPID GROWTH IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY
 ENCOURAGE GROWTH IN A CAREFULLY-MANAGED FORESTRY SECTOR
 
 
 AGRICULTURE AND FOOD ARE A CORNERSTONE OF THE 
 IRISH ECONOMY, AND FIANNA FÁIL ARE DETERMINED THAT THEY WILL REMAIN SO INTO THE 
 NEXT CENTURY. IRISH AGRICULTURE AND ITS ASSOCIATED FOOD INDUSTRY HAS THE 
 POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO ECONOMIC GROWTH AND RURAL PROSPERITY.
 BUT MAKING THIS HAPPEN WILL REQUIRE RADICAL 
 CHANGE. STRONG EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP IS VITAL. 
 FIANNA FÁIL HAS THE EXPERIENCE, CAPACITY AND 
 DETERMINATION NECESSARY TO PUT IN PLACE THE RANGE OF DYNAMIC POLICIES THAT WILL 
 LEAD THIS GREAT INDUSTRY INTO A PROSPEROUS NEW CENTURY. THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE 
 FIANNA FÁIL STRATEGY ARE SET DOWN IN THE POSITION PAPER, A FUTURE IN FARMING.
  REFORMING THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
 FIANNA FÁIL WILL CARRY OUT THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL 
 REFORM OF THE DEPARTMENT SINCE IT WAS SET UP IN 1900. 
 OUR AIM IS TO FOCUS THE DEPARTMENT OF 
 AGRICULTURE ON WHAT WE SEE AS ITS CENTRAL MISSION  DEVELOPING POLICY TO ENSURE 
 THAT IRISH AGRICULTURE REACHES ITS FULL POTENTIAL IN THE 21ST CENTURY. 
 DEVELOPING THIS POLICY WILL BECOME THE MAIN 
 CONCERN OF THE DEPARTMENT UNDER FIANNA FÁIL. THE NEED FOR REFOCUSING IS URGENT: 
 THE NEXT ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS TO DEAL WITH THE POST-GATT ERA AND THE 
 ENLARGEMENT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IS IMMINENT. FOR DAIRYING AND BEEF, WHICH 
 ACCOUNT FOR TWO THIRDS OF OUR AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT, THESE NEGOTIATIONS WILL 
 START WITHIN MONTHS.
 FIANNA FÁILIS REFORM WILL ENSURE THAT IN FUTURE 
 WE BECOME NOT POLICY TAKERS BUT POLICY MAKERS, BASED ON A CLEAR VISION AS TO 
 HOW OUR AGRICULTURE IS TO DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE. WE WILL CREATE A DEPARTMENT 
 WITH THE CAPACITY TO PUT FORWARD THE BEST OPTIONS TO GOVERNMENT AND TO 
 IMPLEMENT ALL SUBSEQUENT DECISIONS EFFECTIVELY.
 TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO CONCENTRATE ON ITS 
 CORE FUNCTION, WE WILL SET UP AN AUTONOMOUS AGENCY TO CONTROL ALL PAYMENTS TO 
 FARMERS. THIS AGENCY WILL BE UNDER THE POLICY DIRECTION OF THE MINISTER AND 
 WILL HAVE ITS OWN ACCOUNTING OFFICER. IT WILL IMPLEMENT POLICY IN THESE AREAS 
 EFFICIENTLY AND COST EFFECTIVELY.
  REBUILDING CREDIBILITY IN THE QUALITY OF IRISH FOOD
 THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT HAVE RESPONDED HASTILY 
 AND QUITE INADEQUATELY TO THE REAL CONCERNS OF CONSUMERS, IN IRELAND AND 
 ELSEWHERE, ABOUT FOOD QUALITY AND SAFETY. 
 THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENTIS ANSWER IS SIMPLY TO 
 ADD ANOTHER LAYER OF BUREAUCRACY  A NEW INSPECTORATE TO OVERSEE THE EXISTING 
 INSPECTORATES. THAT IS A COSMETIC SOLUTION TO A MAJOR PROBLEM THAT THREATENS 
 THE ENTIRE FUTURE OF IRISH AGRICULTURE AND FOOD. IT IS A SOLUTION THAT BECAUSE 
 OF ITS STRUCTURE  SITTING ON TOP OF THE EXISTING MECHANISMS THAT HAVE FAILED 
 CAN NEVER WIN THE CREDIBILITY NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT ITS FUNCTION PROPERLY.
 FIANNA FÁILIS APPROACH, IN CONTRAST, IS TO GO 
 TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER. WE WILL SET UP A SEPARATE, TOTALLY-INDEPENDENT 
 SCIENCE-BASED BODY WITH TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR GUARANTEEING THE SAFETY AND 
 QUALITY OF ALL FOOD, AND WITH ALL THE POWERS AND STRUCTURE NECESSARY TO DO SO.
 FIANNA FÁILIS FOOD QUALITY AUTHORITY WILL TAKE 
 OVER (NOT MERELY ÒOVERSEEÓ) ALL CURRENT FUNCTIONS THAT RELATE TO THE REGULATION 
 OF THE FOOD INDUSTRY, ANIMAL AND PLANT HEALTH, APPROVAL OF DRUGS AND CHEMICALS 
 FOR USE IN FOOD PRODUCTION, IMPLEMENTATION OF SAFETY ASSURANCE SCHEMES AT FARM 
 AND FACTORY LEVEL AND OTHER RELATED AREAS.
 WITHOUT ADDING A FURTHER LEVEL OF BUREAUCRACY, 
 IT WILL TAKE FULL AND INDEPENDENT CONTROL OF THE RELEVANT STAFF AND OTHER 
 RESOURCES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND A MULTIPLICITY OF OTHER 
 AGENCIES.
 THE FOOD QUALITY AUTHORITY WILL, UNDER THE 
 POLICY DIRECTION OF THE MINISTER FOR FOOD, HAVE ITS OWN BOARD AND ACCOUNTING 
 OFFICER, WHO WILL BE INDEPENDENTLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR IMPLEMENTING THE STANDARDS 
 SET IN EU REGULATIONS AND NATIONAL LEGISLATION.
 SO STRUCTURED, IT WILL BE ABLE TO PLAY A 
 CREDIBLE ROLE IN RESTORING CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN IRISH FOOD, ON NATIONAL AND 
 INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.
  ENSURING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
 WE CAN NEVER AFFORD TO BE COMPLACENT ABOUT 
 IRELANDIS GREEN IMAGE, WHICH IS CRITICAL IN MARKETING NOT ONLY OUR FOOD BUT THE 
 COUNTRY AS A WHOLE FOR TOURISM AND INWARD INVESTMENT. 
 TO MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE THIS IMAGE, FIANNA FÁIL 
 WILL PURSUE SUSTAINABILITY IN AGRICULTURE, VIA THESE OBJECTIVES:
   CONSERVING WATER, SOIL AND GENETIC RESOURCES.
   DECREASING CHEMICAL INPUTS TO THE POINT WHERE THERE IS NO ADVERSE EFFECT ON 
SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION.
   MAINTAINING EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN THE INPUT OF NUTRIENTS AND THE ABSORPTION 
CAPACITY OF SOILS AND PLANTS.
   FOSTERING RURAL ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT, MAINTAINING BIO-DIVERSITY AND NATURAL 
HABITATS, AND MINIMISING NATURAL RISKS LIKE EROSION AND FIRES.
  CREATING AN INTEGRATED LAND USE POLICY THROUGH CONSULTATION 
 LAND IS OUR SINGLE MOST VALUABLE RESOURCE. BUT 
 CONFLICTS ARE NOW ARISING ON HOW THIS LAND IS USED FOR THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT OF 
 THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND. 
 A VARIETY OF INTERESTS, FROM FORESTRY TO 
 FARMING, FROM CONSERVATIONISTS TO INDUSTRIES ATTEMPTING TO GENERATE WEALTH FROM 
 OUR LIMITED NATURAL RESOURCES, ARE TRYING TO OPERATE WITHIN CURRENT PIECEMEAL 
 POLICIES. GENUINE LOCAL CONCERNS ARE NOT BEING MET THROUGH ADEQUATE 
 CONSULTATION AND INVOLVEMENT IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS.
 FIANNA FÁIL WILL DEVELOP AN INTEGRATED LAND USE 
 POLICY FOLLOWING A COMPREHENSIVE CONSULTATION PROCESS. 
 THIS WILL ENSURE
   THAT AGRICULTURE CAN CONTINUE TO DEVELOP BUT IN A SUSTAINABLE MANNER;
   THAT SPECIAL AREAS OF CONSERVATION ARE EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENTED, BUT WITH DUE 
REGARD FOR THOSE RESIDING IN AND EARNING A LIVING IN THESE AREAS;
   THAT APPROPRIATE FORESTRY DEVELOPMENT IS FACILITATED.
 WE WILL REVIEW THE ENTIRE PRESENT RANGE OF 
 ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEVELOPMENT MEASURES AS PART OF THIS PROCESS.
  DEVELOPING A COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURAL SECTOR 
 IRELAND HAS CLEAR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES IN 
 GRASS-BASED AGRICULTURE AND IN DAIRYING IN PARTICULAR, BUT. CURRENT POLICIES DO 
 NOT ALLOW THESE ADVANTAGES TO BE EXPLOITED. PROGRESSIVE FARMERS MUST HAVE THE 
 OPPORTUNITY OF MEETING CLEARLY-EXPRESSED MARKET DEMANDS FOR THEIR PRODUCTS.
 FIANNA FÁIL WILL SET UP A NEW PARTNERSHIP 
 BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, TEAGASC, FARM ORGANISATIONS AND FOOD 
 PROCESSORS TO DEVELOP THIS SECTION OF THE INDUSTRY. A FOCUSED RESEARCH, 
 TRAINING AND ADVISORY PROGRAMME, SUPPORTED BY MARKET RESEARCH, WILL UNDERPIN 
 THIS.
  SUPPORTING THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF FAMILY FARMS
 THE FUTURE VIABILITY OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
 SMALLER FARMS, ESPECIALLY DRY STOCK FARMS, IS BEING UNDERMINED BY THE PRESENT 
 SYSTEM OF INCOME SUPPORTS. DESPITE THE VERY LARGE SUMS OF MONEY CURRENTLY PAID 
 OUT, THESE FARMERS DO NOT HAVE VIABLE INCOMES. 
 SOME 70% OF FARMERS GET ONLY 30% OF DIRECT 
 PAYMENTS. SOME 57,000 FARMERS RECEIVE LESS THAN £40 A WEEK IN DIRECT PAYMENTS, 
 WHILE AT THE OTHER END OF THE SCALE 1,000 FARMERS GET DIRECT PAYMENTS OF 
 £60,000 AND UPWARDS EACH YEAR.
 FIANNA FAIL WILL REFORM THE EXISTING DIRECT 
 PAYMENTS SCHEME. THIS WILL ENSURE A MORE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPORT 
 PAYMENTS, ENHANCING THE VIABILITY OF THOUSANDS OF THREATENED FARM FAMILIES AND 
 MAKING MORE EFFICIENT THE ADMINISTRATION OF DIRECT PAYMENTS.
 YOUNG FARMERS. WITH STRINGENT SUPPLY CONTROLS 
 IN ALL MAJOR AREAS OF FARMING, YOUNG FARMERS TAKING OVER  RELATIVELY 
 UNDERDEVELOPED HOLDINGS HAVE VERY LIMITED DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS. IN THE 
 RENEGOTIATION OF EU POLICY, FIANNA FÁIL WILL ENSURE THAT ADEQUATE PROVISION IS 
 MADE TO ENSURE ACCESS TO QUOTAS OR PRODUCTION RIGHTS BY QUALIFIED NEW ENTRANTS. 
 WE WILL SUPPORT STAMP DUTY EXEMPTION FOR YOUNG FARMERS TAKING OVER FAMILY 
 HOLDINGS.
 WOMEN IN AGRICULTURE. THE KEY CONTRIBUTION OF 
 WOMEN IN AGRICULTURE HAS LARGELY GONE UNRECOGNISED. THE VOICE OF WOMEN IN 
 AGRICULTURE IS VIRTUALLY UNHEARD DUE TO LACK OF REPRESENTATION. FIANNA FÁIL 
 WILL SET UP A SPECIAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO ADVISE ON AND MONITOR PROGRESS WITH 
 POLICY INITIATIVES TO SUPPORT WOMEN IN AGRICULTURE. THESE WILL INCLUDE SETTING 
 UP A NETWORK OF WOMEN IN FARMING, AND ADDRESSING THE SPECIFIC TRAINING 
 REQUIREMENTS OF WOMEN IN AGRICULTURE.
  REFORMING THE TAX SYSTEM 
 GRANTS FOR POLLUTION CONTROL AND THE 
 DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE ENTERPRISES HAVE GONE TO PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE 
 SIGNIFICANT TAXABLE INCOMES, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THERE IS INADEQUATE FUNDING 
 FOR ON-FARM INVESTMENT ON SMALLER FARMS. MANY LARGER FARMERS CAN AVAIL OF TAX 
 RELIEF FOR INVESTMENTS OFF FARMS, BUT NOT FOR INVESTMENT ON THEIR HOLDINGS.
 FIANNA FÁIL WILL PUT IN PLACE A NEW SCHEME OF 
 DEVELOPMENT INCENTIVES. FARMERS WITH TAXABLE INCOMES WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO 
 AVAIL OF TAX RELIEF FOR ON-FARM INVESTMENT PURPOSES AND FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
 ALTERNATIVE ENTERPRISES. THE LIMITED GRANT-AID AVAILABLE WILL BE TARGETED AT 
 SMALLER FARMERS WITH LOW INCOMES.
  STIMULATING RAPID GROWTH IN OUR FOOD INDUSTRY
 EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THE IRISH FOOD INDUSTRY 
 CAN BE RIGHTLY PROUD OF THE SECTORIS TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENTS OVER THE PAST 
 DECADE. FIANNA FÁIL IN GOVERNMENT WILL PUT IN PLACE A WIDE RANGE OF STRUCTURES 
 AND INCENTIVES TO STIMULATE FURTHER RAPID GROWTH IN OUR PREMIER INDIGENOUS 
 INDUSTRY.
 RECOGNISING THE EVER-INCREASING COMPETITIVENESS 
 AND STANDARDS OF THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETPLACE, OUR COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES 
 PLACE A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON CREATING AN EXCITING ENVIRONMENT OF INCREASING 
 OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRODUCERS, PROCESSORS AND DISTRIBUTORS.
 THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE FIANNA FÁIL STRATEGY 
 FOR THE FOOD INDUSTRY ARE DETAILED IN OUR TWO POSITION PAPERS FOOD  A BLUEPRINT 
 FOR OPTIMAL DEVELOPMENT, AND SECURING THE INTEGRITY OF IRISH FOOD. 
 THEY INCLUDE:
  RE-ESTABLISHING THE OFFICE OF FOOD, SET UP BY FIANNA FÁIL IN 1987;
  RESTORING CONSUMER CONFIDENCE THROUGH AN AUTONOMOUS FOOD QUALITY AUTHORITY;
  INITIATING AN INVESTMENT PROGRAMME IN THE BEEF PROCESSING INDUSTRY, TO IMPROVE 
ITS COMPETITIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY;
  ENCOURAGING A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PRODUCT INNOVATION WITHIN THE DAIRY 
INDUSTRY;
  DYNAMICALLY EXPANDING THE PIGMEAT INDUSTRY, THE PREPARED CONSUMER FOODS 
SECTOR, AND THE EMERGING FOOD INGREDIENTS SECTOR.
  REINFORCING THE MARKETING DRIVE FOR IRISH FOOD TO MAINTAIN EXISTING MARKETS 
AND TO SECURE NEW ONES, THROUGH SUPPORT FOR SPECIFIC MARKETING INITIATIVES BY AN 
BORD BIA;
  IMPLEMENTING A COMPREHENSIVE AND INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMME, INCLUDING 
TREATMENT OF AGRICULTURAL WASTE AND BY-PRODUCTS, AND THE HUMANE MANAGEMENT OF 
LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY;
  LAUNCHING A NATIONAL HUMAN RESOURCES PROGRAMME TO ENSURE THE READY 
AVAILABILITY OF STRATEGIC MANAGERS, SKILLED IN THE VARIOUS SUB-SPECIALTIES 
WITHIN THE FOOD INDUSTRY AND WITH MULTI-LINGUAL SKILLS;
  PROVIDING AN INCENTIVE PACKAGE TO ASSIST IN THE NECESSARY UPGRADING OF 
ABATTOIRS, AS A COMPONENT OF THE OVERALL EMPHASIS ON FOOD QUALITY AND SAFETY;
  GIVING PRIORITY TO R&D INVESTMENT IN HORTICULTURE, WHICH IS STILL UNDER-
PERFORMING DESPITE SOME NOTABLE SUCCESSES. WE WILL SUPPORT A SUBSTANTIAL 
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT FOR VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS, RESEARCH NEW PROCESSING 
TECHNOLOGIES FOR FIELD VEGETABLES AND MUSHROOMS, AND PILOT TEST NEW CROPS TO 
IDENTIFY NEW COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES.
  ENCOURAGING GROWTH IN A CAREFULLY-MANAGED FORESTRY SECTOR
 FIANNA FÁIL IS COMMITTED TO A FOREST INDUSTRY 
 THAT IS BOTH ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND FINANCIALLY VIABLE, AND WHICH 
 EXPLOITS IRELANDIS COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE IN GROWING TREES.
 WE WILL: 
  ENCOURAGE A HIGH LEVEL OF TREE PLANTING, WITH A PROPER BALANCE OF DECIDUOUS 
AND BROADLEAF;
  SEEK A PROPER BALANCE BETWEEN INDEPENDENT FARMER FORESTRY AND OTHER FORESTRY, 
RECOGNISING THAT THE PLANTATION HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN SUPPLEMENTING FARM 
INCOMES;
  INSIST ON PROPER MAINTENANCE AND MANAGEMENT AS A CONDITION FOR THE DRAW-DOWN 
OF ALL PREMIUMS, TO ENCOURAGE A HIGH QUALITY CROP WITH THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL FOR 
ADDED VALUE;
  SET UP A MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR THE SUPPLY OF TIMBER TO THE PROCESSING 
INDUSTRY, TO SUSTAIN THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF JOBS.
 WE WILL PREPARE A SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY PLAN, 
 ADDRESSING ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. ALL PLANTATIONS WILL BE CONTROLLED 
 WITH REGARD TO THEIR IMPACT ON AGRICULTURE, THE ENVIRONMENT, LOCAL COMMUNITIES 
 AND PROPERTY. WE WILL BRING IN A CODE OF PRACTICE, IN CO-OPERATION WITH 
 INTERESTED GROUPS INCLUDING FARMERS, FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF FORESTS AND 
 PLANTATIONS.
 PUBLIC NOTICES WILL BE REQUIRED BEFORE 
 PLANTING, TO PROTECT NATURAL HABITATS AND WATERCOURSES FROM SIDE-EFFECTS AND 
 COMMUNITIES AND RESIDENCES FROM THE DANGER OF FOREST FIRES. ALL GRANTS FOR 
 PLANTATIONS OVER 20 HECTARES WILL BE SUBJECT TO PERMISSION FROM THE RELEVANT 
 AUTHORITIES. ALL CLEAR-FELLED LAND WILL BE REPLANTED WITHIN A TIME LIMIT TO 
 PREVENT VISUAL BLIGHT. WE WILL CONTROL WILD-LIFE SHOOTING LICENCES IN FORESTRY 
 AND WILL DESIGNATE SOME PLANTATIONS AS BIRD SANCTUARIES.

   
   MARINE
     HARNESSING OUR MARINE RESOURCES
 FIANNA FÁIL IN GOVERNMENT WILL
 FIGHT TO RETAIN OUR EXISTING FISH QUOTAS AND SEEK TO UPGRADE OUR FLEET
 MAKE THE INDUSTRY ATTRACTIVE TO PROVIDERS OF CAPITAL
 SEEK TO DEVELOP A MID-WATER WHITE FISH FLEET
 MAXIMISE THE AMOUNT OF FISH PROCESSED TO SECOND OR HIGHER LEVEL
 TRANSFER SMALLER HARBOURS TO LOCAL CONTROL
 DEVELOP AQUACULTURE IN A FAIR, EQUITABLE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY-CONSCIOUS WAY.
 PROTECT AND DEVELOP OUR COAST THROUGH A NEW COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY
 DEVELOP A STRATEGIC POLICY FOR IRISH COMMERCIAL SHIPPING AND HARBOURS
 
 
  FIGHTING TO PRESERVE OUR FISHING INDUSTRY
 FIANNA FÁIL ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING OUR 
 EXISTING FISH QUOTAS AND WILL FIGHT FOR PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT FOR OUR COASTAL 
 COMMUNITIES, AS THESE ARE IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD PERIPHERAL REGIONS. 
 ANY ATTEMPT TO REDUCE THE FLEET TONNAGE, AS HAS 
 BEEN PROPOSED BY THE EU, WOULD RESULT IN A DRASTIC REDUCTION IN FISHERY-RELATED 
 EMPLOYMENT FOR OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES. THE IMPORTANCE OF FISHING TO IRELAND IS 
 NOT JUST THAT IT PROVIDES EMPLOYMENT FOR 15,000 AND EARNS £150 MILLION A YEAR, 
 BUT THAT IT DOES THIS IN COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE IS VERY LITTLE OTHER ECONOMIC 
 ACTIVITY. 
 THE NEED FOR IRELAND'S FISHING INDUSTRY IS TO 
 GROW, BOTH AT SEA AND IN ON-SHORE PROCESSING ACTIVITIES.
 INSTEAD OF DOWNSIZING, FIANNA FÁIL BELIEVE THAT 
 IRELAND MUST FIGHT FOR THE RIGHT TO UPGRADE OUR FLEET, WHICH WE SHOULD BE 
 REPLACING WITH AN EQUIVALENT NEW TONNAGE. IN ADDITION, ANY SPARE TONNAGE BOUGHT 
 FROM RETIRING FISHERMEN SHOULD BE ALLOCATED TO YOUNG SKIPPERS QUALIFYING FROM 
 OUR TRAINING SCHOOLS, AS THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN BRING MORE YOUNG QUALIFIED 
 FISHERMEN INTO THE INDUSTRY.
 OUR FISHING INDUSTRY IS STILL GROSSLY 
 UNDERCAPITALISED, LACKING IN PROFESSIONAL MANAGEMENT, AND WITH LITTLE OR NO 
 INVOLVEMENT BY IRISH BANKS OR INVESTMENT FUNDS. TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE IN THE 
 INDUSTRY WE MUST ENSURE THE BEST POSSIBLE TRAINING FOR OUR FISHERMEN AND MAKE 
 THE INDUSTRY ATTRACTIVE TO PROVIDERS OF CAPITAL..
 FIANNA FÁIL WILL LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITY OF 
 EXTENDING BES ELIGIBILITY TO PROJECTS FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF FISHING VESSELS UP 
 TO 20 METRES.
 TO REMAIN COMMERCIAL IN DEMERSAL FISHING WITHIN 
 THE EU, WE RECOGNISE THAT WE MUST DEVELOP A MID-WATER, WHITE FISH FLEET, 
 CAPABLE OF FISHING THE PORCUPINE AND THE ROCKALL BANKS IN ALL WEATHER.
 FISH HARVESTING. THE IRISH RATIO OF SHORE TO 
 SEA JOBS IS EXTREMELY LOW AT ONE AND A HALF TO ONE, WHEREAS IN OTHER EU 
 COUNTRIES THE RATIO IS AS HIGH AS SEVEN TO ONE. FIANNA FÁIL ARE COMMITTED TO 
 ENCOURAGING THE NECESSARY INVESTMENT IN ORDER TO INCREASE EMPLOYMENT AND TO GU
 ARANTEE THE SURVIVAL OF THE SECONDARY PROCESSING INDUSTRY. 
 TO ACHIEVE THIS, IT IS VITAL THAT WE MAXIMISE 
 THE VOLUME OF FISH PROCESSED TO A SECOND OR HIGHER LEVEL. ONLY  77% OF FISH 
 CAUGHT IN OUR WATERS IS LANDED HERE FOR PROCESSING, AND ONLY 20% OF THE FISH 
 PROCESSED IS OF HIGH ADDED-VALUE. FIANNA FÁIL BELIEVE THIS MIX MUST BE CHANGED 
 IF WE ARE TO MAINTAIN EMPLOYMENT IN FISH PROCESSING.
 FIANNA FÁIL ARE COMMITTED TO DELIVERING THE 
 NECESSARY INVESTMENT IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE SURVIVAL AND GROWTH OF THE 
 SECONDARY PROCESSING INDUSTRY.WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE LANDING OF ALL IRISH 
 CATCHES AT IRISH PORTS, AND OTHER EU-REGISTERED VESSELS WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO 
 DO THE SAME.
 HARBOURS. FIANNA FÁIL BELIEVE THAT IN ADDITION 
 TO THE PLANNED UPGRADING OF THE 25 LARGER HARBOURS, A LONG-TERM PROGRAMME MUST 
 BE INITATED WHEREBY A LARGE NUMBER OF THE SMALLER HARBOURS ARE TRANSFERRED TO 
 THE LOCAL COUNTY COUNCILS AND COMMUNITY FOR DEVELOPMENT FOR FISHING, LEISURE 
 AND TOURIST ACTIVIITY.
 AQUACULTURE. THE UNCONTROLLED DEVELOPMENT OF 
 THIS INDUSTRY MUST BE RECTIFIED. FIANNA FÁIL WILL IMPLEMENT EXISTING 
 LEGISLATION OR MODIFY IT AS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT A FAIR AND EQUITABLE 
 SYSTEM IS PUT IN PLACE, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED IN THIS £50 
MILLION INDUSTRY.
 SEAWEED. FIANNA FÁIL WILL BRING IN LEGISLATION 
 TO ALLOW THE SEMI-STATE COMPANY ARRAMARA TEORANTA TO DEVELOP THE 
 ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY SEAWEED INDUSTRY TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL.
 SAFETY. FIANNA FÁIL WILL IMPLEMENT THE 
 RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE FISHERY VESSEL SAFETY REVIEW GROUP ON VESSEL SAFETY AND 
 THE TRAINING OF DECK HANDS. TO SPEED UP THE LOCATION AND RESCUE OF VESSELS IN 
 DISTRESS, WE WILL ALSO EXAMINE THE POSSIBILITY OF EQUIPPING ALL FISHING VESSELS 
 WITH AN ELECTRONIC LOCATING DEVICE.
  A STRATEGY POLICY FOR SHIPPING AND HARBOURS
 FIANNA FÁIL WILL DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY 
 FOR THE SHIPPING INDUSTRY. OUR TRADE, BOTH IMPORT AND EXPORT, IS VIRTUALLY ALL 
 CARRIED BY SEA IN CONTAINERS, BULK OR ROLL-ON ROLL-OFF FERRIES. 
 IT IS VITAL THAT AS A NATION WE TAKE A 
 STRATEGIC VIEW OF THE IRISH SHIPPING INDUSTRY, AND DEVELOP THE NECESSARY 
 INFRASTRUCTURE TO HANDLE THE EXPECTED INCREASES IN VOLUME OVER THE NEXT DECADE.
 THIS WILL REQUIRE INVESTMENT IN ACCESS TO PORTS 
 AND CONTINUING INVESTMENT IN THE PORTS THEMSELVES TO HANDLE INCREASED VOLUMES 
 AND LARGER SHIPS. 
 FIANNA FÁIL WILL ENCOURAGE CONTINUED INVESTMENT 
 IN MODERN TONNAGE BY IRISH COMPANIES IN IRISH-FLAGGED SHIPS EMPLOYING IRISH AND 
 EU CITIZENS. 
 THIS WILL MEAN ENSURING THAT IRISH COMPANIES 
 ARE NOT DISADVANTAGED COMPETITIVELY AND THAT IRISH PORTS ARE ENCOURAGED TO BE 
 COMPETITIVE IN THEIR PRICING STRUCTURE AND COMMERCIAL IN THEIR OPERATIONS. 
 FIANNA FÁIL WILL CONSULT WIDELY WITH THE 
 INDUSTRY TO ENSURE THAT ALL ASPECTS OF THE VITAL LIFELINE TO TRADE ARE 
 UNDERSTOOD AND DEVELOPED.
  PROTECTING AND DEVELOPING OUR COAST
 IRELANDIS COAST IS A MAJOR NATIONAL RESOURCE. 
 IT HAS HUGE POTENTIAL FROM MANY PERSPECTIVES  ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL AND 
 SOCIOLOGICAL. MANAGED PROPERLY, IT IS A NATIONAL ASSET OF IMMENSE VALUE.
 TO REALISE THIS POTENTIAL, FIANNA FÁIL IN 
 GOVERNMENT WILL IMPLEMENT A 10-YEAR PLAN TO:
  PROTECT THE HIGH QUALITY OF THE COASTAL ENVIRONMENT.
  REFURBISH COASTLINES AT RISK.
  DEVELOP TOURISM, FISHING AND LEISURE FACILITIES IN COASTAL REGIONS.
 WE WILL ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES BY SETTING UP 
 A COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY. IT WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL COASTAL 
 MATTERS AND HAVE A REGULATORY ROLE IN COASTAL ZONE DEVELOPMENT.

   SEMI-STATE COMPANIES
     RE-CREATING A DYNAMIC STATE SECTOR
 FIANNA FÁIL IN GOVERNMENT WILL
 TAKE A PRACTICAL RATHER THAN AN IDEOLOGICAL APPROACH TO STATE COMPANIES, 
WORKING IN THE SPIRIT OF SOCIAL PARTNERSHIP AND CONSENSUS
 RE-ESTABLISH THE COMPANIES AS ENGINES OF GROWTH
 MAKE THEM VIABLE FOR THE LONG-TERM IN AN ERA OF EU-REQUIRED COMPETITION
 PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL WHERE NECESSARY BY BROADENING THE SHAREHOLDING BASE 
TO INCLUDE EMPLOYEES, PENSION FUNDS, INDIVIDUAL IRISH INVESTORS, AS WELL AS 
STRATEGIC PARTNERS
 GIVE THEM THE COMMERCIAL FREEDOMS NECESSARY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY, WHILE 
ENSURING THAT THEIR ROLE AS PUBLIC SERVICE PROVIDERS IS MAINTAINED
 ENCOURAGE THEM TO GROW OVERSEAS SO AS TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIES OF SCALE
 
 
  REJECTING IDEOLOGY IN FAVOUR OF PRACTICALITY
 FIANNA FÁILIS AIM IS TO REINVIGORATE THE STATE 
 ENTERPRISES AND TO CREATE A NEW RENAISSANCE IN THE SECTOR. OUR POLICY TOWARDS 
 THE SEMI-STATE SECTOR HAS ALWAYS BEEN PRACTICAL RATHER THAN IDEOLOGICAL. 
 OUR PHILOSOPHY AND TRACK-RECORD HAS 
 CONSISTENTLY BEEN TO SUPPORT SEMI-STATE COMPANIES AS ENGINES OF ECONOMIC 
 GROWTH. THESE COMPANIES HAVE PLAYED A VITAL ROLE IN IRELANDIS MODERNISATION, 
 AND INCLUDE SOME OF OUR MOST OUTSTANDING ENTERPRISES. 
 FIANNA FÁIL BELIEVE THIS ROLE SHOULD CONTINUE. 
 IN OUR VIEW, A HEALTHY ECONOMY WILL INCLUDE A 
 HEALTHY EVOLVING STATE SECTOR THAT SEEKS TO ACHIEVE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENTS IN 
 ALL-ROUND COMPETITIVENESS, AND ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF  SERVICE GIVEN TO THE 
 PUBLIC. 
 FIANNA FÁIL WILL NOT ENGAGE IN A WHOLESALE 
 DISMANTLING OR DISPOSAL OF STATE COMPANIES. 
 WE WILL NOT SELL OFF STATE ASSETS CHEAP TO MAKE 
 QUICK PROFITS FOR INVESTORS, AT THE COST OF HIGHER PRICES TO THE CONSUMER 
 AND/OR A LOWERING OF SERVICE QUALITY. 
  CREATING A STRATEGY THAT IS RIGHT FOR IRELAND
 FIANNA FÁIL WILL BE FORWARD-LOOKING, NOT 
 DEFENSIVE, ABOUT THE FUTURE STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT OF SEMI-STATE COMPANIES. IT 
 IS A TIME OF CHANGE IN THE STATE SECTOR, CHANGE THAT IS BEING DRIVEN BY 
 TECHNOLOGY, BY EU DEREGULATION AND COMPETITION. IT IS FIRM EU POLICY TO INSIST 
 ON COMPETITION IN ALL AREAS NOW COVERED BY COMMERCIAL SEMI-STATE COMPANIES. 
 FIANNA FÁIL BELIEVE THAT COMPETITION IS GOOD 
 FOR THE ECONOMY. WE ARE OPPOSED TO NON-ESSENTIAL MONOPOLIES IN THE LONG-TERM, 
 BE THEY PRIVATE OR PUBLIC, AND WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT STATE COMPANIES HAVE THE 
 POTENTIAL TO MEET ANY COMPETITION FACING THEM. WE WILL WORK TO MAKE THEM 
 EFFICIENT AND PROFITABLE, UNDERPINNING THEIR VIABILITY FOR THE LONG-TERM. 
 BUT FIANNA FÁIL WILL NOT FORCE EFFICIENT 
 COMPANIES INTO STRUCTURAL CONTORTIONS, JUST SO AS TO FIT SOME EU DESIGN 
 TAILORED FOR MUCH LARGER ECONOMIES. OUR REGENERATION OF THE SEMI-STATE SECTOR 
 WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SIZE OF THE IRISH MARKET. FIANNA FÁIL WILL 
 VIGOROUSLY PURSUE WHAT IS IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST AND WE WILL FIGHT OUR CORNER 
 IN NEGOTIATING EU DIRECTIVES TO MAKE SURE WE GET THE TYPE OF COMPETITIVE RÉGIME 
 WE CAN LIVE WITH.
  MEETING THE NEED FOR NEW CAPITAL
 A FURTHER IMPETUS TOWARDS CHANGE IS THAT MANY 
 OF THE COMPANIES HAVE CONSIDERABLE CAPITAL NEEDS. IT IS NOT REALISTIC TO EXPECT 
 THE TAXPAYER TO FUND FURTHER LARGE INJECTIONS OF CAPITAL  EVEN IF THE EU 
 ALLOWED IT. 
 FIANNA FÁIL WILL ALLOW STATE COMPANIES NEEDING 
 CAPITAL TO LOOK TO IRISH PENSION FUNDS, ON THE BASIS OF A LONG-TERM INVESTOR 
 RELATIONSHIP. WE WILL CONSIDER THE OPTION OF STRATEGIC ALLIANCES ABROAD ON 
 THEIR MERITS, CASE BY CASE. 
 IN BROADENING THE SHAREHOLDING IN SEMI-STATE 
 COMPANIES, WE WILL LOOK BEYOND PENSION FUNDS AND STRATEGIC PARTNERS TO INCLUDE 
 INDIVIDUAL IRISH INVESTORS AND ALSO TO THE EMPLOYEES OF THESE COMPANIES. WE SEE 
 EMPLOYEE SHAREHOLDINGS AS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN THE SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT OF 
 CHANGE IN THE SEMI-STATE SECTOR. FIANNA FÁIL WILL RESERVE FOR WORKERS IN STATE 
 COMPANIES THE RIGHT TO BUY UP TO 15 PER CENT OF THE SHARES AT A FAIR PRICE.
 WE WILL GUARANTEE EFFECTIVE NATIONAL CONTROL OF 
 VITAL UTILITIES, AS LONG AS IS NECESSARY, GENERALLY BY CONTINUED STATE MAJORITY 
 SHAREHOLDING OR IN OTHER CASES THROUGH THE ÔGOLDEN SHAREI MECHANISM.
 THE PUBLIC SERVICE ETHOS WILL NOT BE LOST SIGHT 
 OF, BUT WE WILL ENSURE THAT IT IS GENUINE AND NOT AN EXCUSE FOR INEFFICIENCY OR 
 INFERIOR QUALITY. WE BELIEVE IN FACING THE CHALLENGES TOGETHER IN A 
 CO-OPERATIVE SPIRIT AND MAINTAINING THE RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST WHICH FIANNA FÁIL 
 HAS FOSTERED WITH THE SOCIAL PARTNERS. THE TRANSITION FROM MONOPOLY STATUS TO 
 COMPETITIVE MARKET PLAYER IS A DEMANDING ONE FOR STATE COMPANIES, AND FIANNA 
 FÁIL IS COMMITTED TO FULLY INVOLVING MANAGEMENTS, UNIONS AND THE SOCIAL 
 PARTNERS GENERALLY IN THE PROCESS. 
  GIVING THE COMPANIES FREEDOM TO GROW
 IF THE STATE COMPANIES ARE TO PERFORM AND 
 SUCCEED IN AN OPEN MARKET, THEN THEY MUST HAVE COMMERCIAL FREEDOMS ON A PAR 
 WITH THEIR COMPETITORS. FIANNA FÁIL WILL PROVIDE THOSE FREEDOMS. BY THE SAME 
 TOKEN, THE COST OF PUBLIC SERVICE OBLIGATIONS, WHICH ARE PROPER AND 
 UNAVOIDABLE, MUST BE BORNE BY ALL THE PLAYERS IN THE MARKET  NOT JUST THE STATE 
 COMPANIES. FIANNA FÁIL WILL MAKE THIS HAPPEN.
 THE FUTURE COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE FOR STATE 
 COMPANIES CANNOT BE RESTRICTED TO IRELAND. STATE COMPANIES, LIKE ANY OTHERS, 
 NEED TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIES OF SCALE IN AN INCREASINGLY GLOBAL ECONOMY. FIANNA 
 FÁIL WILL THEREFORE SEEK TO DEVELOP THE POTENTIAL OF SOME OF THE RESTRUCTURED 
 STATE COMPANIES AS IRISH MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES WITH SIGNIFICANT OVERSEAS 
 SALES OPPORTUNITIES. 
 WE WILL SUPPORT THEIR DEVELOPMENT OVERSEAS IN 
 THE SAME WAY AS GROWING IRISH INDIGENOUS COMPANIES:. SOME COMPANIES  SUCH AS 
 AER RIANTA, ESB AND TELECOM  HAVE ALREADY DEVELOPED OVERSEAS IN A MODEST WAY. 
 FIANNA FÁIL WILL MAKE IT GOVERNMENT POLICY TO PROMOTE THEM AS MULTI-NATIONAL 
 OPERATORS AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO EXPAND THROUGH ACTIVE STRATEGIES OVERSEAS.

FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE THE TIME HAS NOW COME TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT AN 
INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY THAT UNITES OUR PEOPLE BEHIND THE CONCEPT OF 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.

UNDER SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS, IRELANDIS RESPONSE TO 
ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS HAS BEEN PIECEMEAL AND INEFFECTIVE. MUCH OF IT HAS BEEN 
DRIVEN BY THE NEED TO MEET EUROPEAN STANDARDS, RATHER THAN BY A WIDELY-HELD 
CONVICTION THAT PRESERVING OUR ENVIRONMENT IS IN OUR INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE 
SELF-INTEREST. 

N WEIGHTY LEGISLATION WAS INTRODUCED AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF LOOMING DEAD-LINES, 
WITH LITTLE REAL DISCUSSION OR CONSULTATION. 

N REGULATION WAS INTRODUCED WITHOUT ANY ANALYSIS OF ITS IMPACT ON NATIONAL 
COMPETITIVENESS. A BLANKET APPROACH TO REGULATION HAS MADE IT HARDER TO ADDRESS 
PROPERLY THE SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS POSED BY INDIVIDUAL SECTORS.
N TOO OFTEN, INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT HAS 
GENERATED CONFLICT AND MISUNDERSTANDING WITH RESULTS THAT HAVE BENEFITED NEITHER 
THE 
ENVIRONMENT NOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

N DECISION-MAKING ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES HAS LACKED TRANSPARENCY, WITH 
EXCESSIVE BARRIERS PLACED ON ACCESS TO INFORMATION BY
CONCERNED CITIZENS. 

N ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY HAS NOT BEEN INTEGRATED ACROSS THE WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT. 
NOR HAS THERE BEEN EFFECTIVE CO-ORDINATION OF THE OVERALL EFFORT. AGENCIES 
INVOLVED IN ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION HAVE BEEN CREATED AD HOC, WITH THE INEVITABLE 
RESULT THAT RESOURCES ARE DEPLOYED INEFFECTIVELY AND 
INEFFICIENTLY. 
  
ELEMENTS OF A NEW APPROACH

INTEGRATING INDUSTRIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY. FIANNA F‡IL WANT TO ACHIEVE A 
HOLISTIC INTEGRATION OF INDUSTRIAL AND ENVIRONMENT POLICY. TREATING POLLUTION 
AND WASTE AFTER IT HAS BEEN PRODUCED MUST BE A LAST RESORT. IN-PROCESS 
RECYCLING, RE-USE OF WASTE, PRODUCT ALTERATION, INPUT SUBSTITUTION AND PROCESS 
CHANGE MUST BE SOUGHT ACROSS THE 
BOARD. 
 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMMES WILL WITH CONSULTATION BE INTRODUCED FOR EACH INDUSTRY 
SECTOR. ONLY THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF CLEAN TECHNOLOGY WILL BE ALLOWED IN NEW 
DEVELOPMENTS. IMPROVEMENTS IN EXISTING FACILITIES WILL BE ADDRESSED ON A 
SECTORAL BASIS.

CONSENSUS THROUGH CONSULTATION. TO ENSURE MAXIMUM INVOLVEMENT BY ALL THOSE 
INTERESTED IN AND AFFECTING THE ENVIRONMENT, A NEW NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT 
PARTNERSHIP FORUM WILL HAVE A MAJOR INPUT INTO ALL PUBLIC POLICY IMPACTING ON 
THE ENVIRONMENT. 

EACH LOCAL AUTHORITY WILL DRAW UP AN ENVIRONMENTAL CHARTER AFTER COMMUNITY-WIDE 
CONSULTATION. THIS CONSULTATION WILL TAKE PLACE THROUGH A LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL 
PARTNERSHIP FORUM INVOLVING ALL RELEVANT STATUTORY AND NON-STATUTORY BODIES, AS 
WELL AS THE COMMUNITY/VOLUNTARY SECTOR. THE LOCAL AUTHORITY WILL SUBMIT 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PLANS TO THIS FORUM.

TRANSPARENCY. FIANNA F‡IL WILL PROVIDE ALL CITIZENS WITH FULL AND EASY ACCESS TO 
INFORMATION HELD BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES ON ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, TO CREATE 
GREATER AWARENESS OF THESE ISSUES AND ENHANCE THE POLICY-MAKING PROCESS. ALL 
ASPECTS OF REGULATION  INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENTS, GRANTS TO 
INDUSTRY AND THE PLANNING PROCESS  WILL BE MADE TOTALLY TRANSPARENT.

A LEAD FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR. THE PUBLIC SECTOR WILL LEAD BY EXAMPLE. EACH 
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT WILL HAVE A 
SPECIFIC HIGH-RANKING OFFICER ASSIGNED TO ENSURE THAT ALL POLICIES ARE 
SUSTAINABLE.  ALL PUBLIC BODIES WILL HAVE A RIGOROUS SYSTEM OF ENVIRONMENTAL 
AUDIT. FIRMS DOING BUSINESS WITH GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO COMPLY WITH CERTIFIABLE 
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS. STATE GRANTS WILL BE DEPENDENT ON COMPLIANCE WITH 
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS. LOCAL AUTHORITIES WILL ENCOURAGE AND ASSIST RECYCLING 
PROJECTS, RECYCLED MATERIALS AND GREEN CONSUMERISM

RATIONALISING THE ROLE OF STATE AGENCIES. THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 
WILL FOCUS ITS RESOURCES ON ENFORCEMENT. FORBAIRT WILL WITHDRAW FROM PROVIDING 
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANCY TO FOCUS ON JOB CREATION, ESPECIALLY IN THE £150 
BILLION ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION INDUSTRY. WE WILL INTEGRATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
MANAGEMENT FUNCTION OF THE NSAI AND THE NATIONAL ACCREDITATION BOARD.
 
MONITORING PROGRESS. WE WILL PUT A STRUCTURE IN PLACE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF 
NEW ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, AND TO REVIEW THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EXISTING 
LEGISLATION AND EU FUNDED PROGRAMMES ON THE ENVIRONMENT.

IMPROVING THE PLANNING PROCESS

FIANNA F‡IL WILL CARRY OUT AN URGENT EXAMINATION OF ALL PLANNING LAW AND 
PRACTICES, BECAUSE OF THEIR CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE ON THE NATURAL AND BUILT 
ENVIRONMENT. 

WE WILL REVIEW AND CONSOLIDATE ALL PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT LEGISLATION, AFTER 
CONSULTATION WITH INTERESTED PARTIES. WE WILL REVIEW ALL CURRENT REGULATIONS ON 
EXEMPTED DEVELOPMENTS, AND INSTITUTE SEVERE PENALTIES FOR UNAUTHORISED 
DEVELOPMENTS.

N WE WILL MAKE STATUTORY PROVISION FOR A PRE-PLANNING PROCESS BETWEEN PLANNER 
AND THE APPLICANT.

WE WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PROFESSIONALLY QUALIFIED PLANNERS, AND CREATE THE 
RESOURCES TO ADDRESS LARGE SCALE OR SPECIALISED PLANNING APPLICATIONS.

N WE WILL CREATE A TRANSPARENT APPEALS SYSTEM, AND GIVE APPLICANTS RECOURSE TO 
LEGAL REDRESS FOR DELAY DUE TO VEXATIONS OR NUISANCE APPEALS. WE WILL MAKE IT
POSSIBLE TO APPEAL COSTS WITHOUT INVALIDATING THE WHOLE PERMISSION.

MAKING RECYCLING A REALITY IN WASTE MANAGEMENT

IRELAND PRODUCES WASTE AT A RATE FAR BEYOND WHAT IS SUSTAINABLE.

FAILURE ON RECYCLING. IRELANDIS RATE OF RECYCLING IS WELL BELOW THE EUROPEAN 
NORM, YET MOST OF OUR WASTE CONTAINS LARGE AMOUNTS OF MATERIAL WHICH COULD BE 
RECOVERED EITHER FOR RECYCLING OR REUSE. 
 
FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE THAT THE PRESENT LARGELY VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENTS FOR 
RECYCLING ARE TOTALLY INADEQUATE. THEY COULD NEVER ADDRESS THE RECYCLING OPTION 
PROPERLY, ESPECIALLY IN THE FACE OF THE RISING VOLUMES OF WASTE.

AS WITH OTHER AREAS OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, THERE IS AN UNCOORDINATED 
APPROACH TO WASTE MANAGEMENT. A NATIONAL PLAN, CO-ORDINATED BY ONE BODY, IS 
ESSENTIAL. FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL DELIVER THIS.

WE WILL SET HIGHER AND MORE VERIFIABLE TARGETS FOR THE RECYCLING OF PACKAGING 
AND INDUSTRIAL WASTE. WE WILL REVIEW THE VOLUNTARY REPAK SCHEME.

THE CRISIS IN LANDFILL. IT IS A SYMPTOM OF OUR NATIONAL FAILURE IN WASTE 
MANAGEMENT THAT LANDFILL REMAINS THE PRIMARY METHOD FOR THE DISPOSAL OF WASTE. 
THIS CANNOT CONTINUE.

WITHIN THE LIFETIME OF THE NEXT D‡IL, 67 OF THE 99 LANDFILL SITES OPERATED BY 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES WILL BE FULL. 

FIANNA F‡IL WILL IMPLEMENT A WASTE HIERARCHY OF 

N PREVENTION

N MINIMISATION

N RECYCLING

N WASTE-TO-ENERGY

N DISPOSAL

ONLY WHEN ALL OTHER OPTIONS ARE EXHAUSTED, WILL WE ALLOW LANDFILL TO BE 
CONSIDERED.

WE WILL INTRODUCE NEW STANDARDS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF LANDFILL AND FEES FOR 
LANDFILL DISPOSAL WILL REFLECT THE ÒPOLLUTER PAYSÓ PRINCIPLE. FEES FROM LANDFILL 
SITES WILL BE PARTLY USED TO MITIGATE THEIR IMPACT ON THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY. 
WE WILL LEVY A TAX ON PLASTIC BAGS, PET BOTTLES AND OTHER CONTAINERS THAT END UP 
IN LANDFILL AND AS LITTER. THE OBJECT OF THIS TAX WILL BE TO DISCOURAGE USE OF 
THESE MATERIALS TO 
THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE EXTENT.

WE WILL INSTRUCT LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO MOVE TOWARDS HAVING HOUSEHOLD AND 
COMMERCIAL WASTE SEGREGATED FOR COLLECTION AND RECYCLING.

WE WILL REQUIRE THE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES TO SEEK OUT AND GIVE 
PRIORITY TO PROJECTS THAT USE RAW MATERIALS DERIVED FROM WASTE.
  
WAGING A WAR ON LITTER

AS A COUNTRY WE SPEND £20 MILLION EACH YEAR TO 
CLEAN UP LITTER, YET WE STILL HAVE A VERY SERIOUS LITTER PROBLEM. THE AMOUNT OF 
LITTER STREWN ALONG OUR CITY STREETS, HIGHWAYS, HEDGEROWS, AND EVEN IN THE MOST 
ISOLATED REGIONS IS A NATIONAL SCANDAL  AND A REAL THREAT TO OUR TOURISM 
INDUSTRY.

FIANNA F‡IL WILL REVIEW EXISTING LAWS ON LITTER AND WASTE, AND WHERE NECESSARY 
STRENGTHEN THEM. EQUALLY IMPORTANT, HOWEVER, WE WILL CONSISTENTLY ENFORCE 
EXISTING LAWS WHICH DOES NOT HAPPEN NOW.

MEASURING AND REWARDING PERFORMANCE. WE WILL INTRODUCE A SYSTEM TO MEASURE 
LITTER. WE WILL GRADE AREAS ON THEIR LITTER PERFORMANCE UNDER A GREEN FLAG 
SCHEME, ALONG THE LINES OF THE BLUE FLAG SCHEME FOR BEACHES. 

LITTER FROM PACKAGING. ALL ESTABLISHMENTS DOING BUSINESS WITH THE PUBLIC WILL 
HAVE TO CONFORM TO LITTER MANAGEMENT PLANS DRAWN UP BY EACH LOCAL AUTHORITY. 
THESE PLANS WILL INCLUDE PROVIDING BINS, SEGREGATING REFUSE AND CLEANING LITTER 
FROM THE VICINITY THROUGHOUT THE HOURS OF TRADING. 

WE WILL REQUIRE FAST-FOOD OUTLETS TO HAVE A LICENCE, AND FAILURE TO CONTROL 
LITTER PROPERLY WILL BE GROUNDS FOR REFUSING RENEWAL. WE WILL INTRODUCE AN 
ÒENVIRONMENTAL TAKEAWAY CHARGEÓ, WHOSE PROCEEDS WILL GO TO CLEAN UP LITTER.

WE WILL OBLIGE ALL BUSINESSES ABOVE A CERTAIN SIZE TO FACILITATE RECYCLING, AT 
LEVELS TO BE SET BY ANNUAL AND MEDIUM-TERM TARGETS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT 
PRODUCERS OF BOTTLES AND CANS, AS WELL AS RETAILERS INCLUDING THE LICENSED 
TRADE, WILL TAKE CRADLE-TO-GRAVE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE PRODUCTS.

PUBLIC EVENTS. WE WILL REQUIRE EVENTS SUCH AS POP CONCERTS TO LODGE A CLEAN-UP 
BOND WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORITY AND DEMONSTRATE THEIR CAPACITY TO CLEAN UP AS THE 
EVENT PROCEEDS AND NOT MERELY AFTERWARDS.

POLLUTION BY ADVERTISEMENTS. WE WILL REQUIRE ADVERTISING STRUCTURES TO HAVE AN 
ANNUAL LICENCE AND CONFORM TO SPECIFICATIONS. IN CASES OF ILLEGAL ADVERTISING, 
THE FIRM WHOSE NAME OR PRODUCT IS ADVERTISED WILL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE AND FINED. 
FINES WILL BE RELATED TO THE CLEAN-UP COST.

ABANDONED CARS. WE WILL MAKE THE LAST OWNER OF A VEHICLE LIABLE IF THE VEHICLE 
BECOMES A NUISANCE.



WE WILL SET UP ENVIRONMENTAL COURTS, FOLLOWING THE MODEL OF THE SPECIAL TRAFFIC 
COURTS.  CONVICTIONS WILL BE 
PUBLICISED IN THE LOCAL MEDIA.  WE WILL USE FINES AND LOCAL
LICENCE FEES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION TO PAY THE COST OF ENFORCEMENT AND FOR 
CLEAN UP PURPOSES.

CONTROLLING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF TRAFFIC

FIANNA F‡IL WILL REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF VEHICLE TRAFFIC IN URBAN AREAS, BY MAKING 
OTHER ALTERNATIVES MORE ATTRACTIVE. LESS TRAFFIC WILL LOWER AIR AND NOISE 
POLLUTION, AND INCREASE EVERYONEIS QUALITY OF LIFE.

WE WILL CREATE A TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR EVERY URBAN AREA, WITH FULL 
CONSULTATION AND VOLUNTARY INPUT. WE WILL APPOINT A  TRAFFIC SUPREMO TO CO-
ORDINATE TRAFFIC CONTROL IN THE CITIES IN LIAISING WITH RELATED AGENCIES.

AS PART OF CO-ORDINATED TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT, WE WILL

N ENCOURAGE CAR SHARING, INITIALLY WITHIN THE PUBLIC SECTOR, 

N IMPROVE ENFORCEMENT OF BUS LANES;

N CREATE A PROGRAMME TO EXTEND CYCLE LANES IN ALL CITIES;

N ENCOURAGE TOWNS AND VILLAGES TO REDUCE PARKING AREAS THAT CAUSE CONGESTION;

N PROMOTE ÒPARK AND RIDEÓ IN CITIES, USING RAPID PUBLIC TRANSPORT FROM PARKING 
AREAS ON THE OUTSKIRTS;

N MAKE FULL USE OF CLAMPING, TOWING AND FINES TO CURB ILLEGAL PARKING IN CITIES 
AND THEIR SUBURBS;

N BAN DELIVERIES IN CITY CENTRES BETWEEN 7AM AND 7PM ON WEEKDAYS;

N ENCOURAGE PEDESTRIANISATION BY MAKING CITIES SAFER AND MORE PLEASANT TO WALK 
IN, AND ENSHRINE PEDESTRIANSI RIGHTS IN A PEDESTRIAN CHARTER;

N OBLIGE DUBLIN BUS TO REDUCE EXHAUST EMISSIONS BY 50%.

IMPLEMENTING ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACROSS GOVERNMENT

FIANNA F‡IL WILL MAKE THE ENVIRONMENT A PRIORITY CONCERN THAT AFFECTS ALL THE 
BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT. INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS WILL PURSUE A VIGOROUS 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMME, WITH AN INTEGRATING AND CO-ORDINATING ROLE PROVIDED BY 
THE MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. 
A CABINET SUB-COMMITTEE WILL ENSURE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY.

FOR DETAILS OF OUR SPECIFIC POLICY INITIATIVES ON THE ENVIRONMENT IN 
AGRICULTURE, ENERGY AND TOURISM, SEE THE SECTIONS OF THIS MANIFESTO DEALING WITH 
THOSE SECTORS.

EDUCATING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

N FIANNA F‡IL WILL INCORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION, PARTICULARLY THE 
CONCEPTS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT INTO PRIMARY AND SECONDARY LEVEL 
CURRICULA. 

N WE WILL SET UP A TASK FORCE UNDER THE HIGHER EDUCATION AUTHORITY WHAT 
EDUCATIONAL CHANGES ARE NECESSARY TO MEET IRELANDIS NEEDS IN THE NEW 
ECOLOGICAL AGE. 

N THE DEPARTMENT OF ENTERPRISE AND EMPLOYMENT WILL IDENTIFY THE TRAINING NEEDS 
REQUIRED BY CHANGES BROUGHT ABOUT BY ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION. 

N TO STIMULATE DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS THAT ARE MORE ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLY THROUGH 
INFORMATION AND THROUGH CONSISTENT STANDARDS IN LABELLING, PACKAGING AND 
ADVERTISING, WE WILL DEVELOP AND PROMOTE AN IRISH ECO-LABEL, AND 
ENCOURAGE INDUSTRY TO EXTEND THE USE OF ECO-LABELLING GENERALLY.
  
DEVELOPING THE FIRE SERVICES

FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC IS OF PARAMOUNT 
IMPORTANCE AT ALL TIMES. ACCORDINGLY, WE WILL IN GOVERNMENT WORK TO DEVELOP 
FURTHER THE NATIONIS FIRE SERVICES. WE WILL UPDATE THE FIRE SERVICES ACT AND 
REVIEW THE FUNDING ALLOCATED TO THE FIRE SERVICES. WE WILL ENCOURAGE A MULTI-
AGENCY APPROACH TO TRAINING AND DRILLS, AND WILL AIM FOR THE HIGHEST STANDARDS 
OF EQUIPMENT AND TRAINING. WE WILL ENCOURAGE BILATERAL PLANS WITH FIRE 
AUTHORITIES NORTH OF THE BORDER.

ACTING VIGOROUSLY ON THE ENVIRONMENT AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL

IN GOVERNMENT, FIANNA F‡IL WILL WORK TO ENSURE THAT EXISTING INTERNATIONAL 
AGREEMENTS ON THE REGULATION OF THE NUCLEAR INDUSTRY ARE STRENGTHENED. WE WILL 
QUESTION THE ECONOMICS AS WELL AS THE SAFETY OF NUCLEAR POWER, AND URGE A 
MORATORIUM ON THE BUILDING OF NEW NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS AND THE PHASING OUT OF 
EXISTING FACILITIES. SIDE BY SIDE WITH THIS, WE WILL PROMOTE THE EXPLORATION OF 
ALTERNATIVE ENERGIES, AS WELL AS MORE EFFICIENT ENERGY USE.


N NON-NUCLEAR COUNTRIES HAVE VERY LITTLE 
PROTECTION UNDER INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS AGAINST THE WORLD NUCLEAR INDUSTRY.  
FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVES THAT EU AND INTERNATIONAL LAW SHOULD ENSURE THAT :

N EVERY NUCLEAR STATE HAS AN INDEPENDENT, EFFECTIVE AND CREDIBLE AUTHORITY TO 
SUPERVISE ITS NUCLEAR INDUSTRY.

N THERE IS A ÒPEER REVIEWÓ PROVISION ALLOWING OTHER STATES TO VERIFY ASSURANCES.

THE NUCLEAR INDUSTRY, AND THE STATES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE, MUST BE TOTALLY 
LIABLE FOR ANY ACCIDENTS AND THE CONSEQUENCES ACROSS INTERNATIONAL BORDERS. 
ADEQUATE FUNDS MUST BE BONDED TO MEET THIS.

N NEIGHBOURING STATES MUST BE ALLOWED TO OBJECT EFFECTIVELY BEFORE A 
COMPETENT INTERNATIONAL FORUM, TO THE BUILDING OF A NUCLEAR FACILITY.

N EU LAWS SHOULD ENSURE THAT THE ÒPOLLUTER PAYSÓ PRINCIPLE IS FULLY ENFORCED IN 
RELATION TO THE DISCHARGES FROM EXISTING NUCLEAR FACILITIES.

SELLAFIELD. SELLAFIELD AND OTHER BRITISH NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS POSE A DEADLY 
THREAT TO OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY. FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL VIGOROUSLY 
PURSUE ALL AVENUES TO HAVE SELLAFIELD AND ITS SISTER STATIONS SHUT. WE HAVE FOR 
MORE THAN TEN YEARS CONSISTENTLY ADVOCATED THE CLOSURE OF THESE PLANTS, AND HAVE 
BEEN PRIME MOVERS IN ALL THE PROGRESS MADE TO DATE. WE WILL NOT REST UNTIL THE 
MATTER IS FINALLY SETTLED TO 
IRELANDIS SATISFACTION.

CREATING NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN ARTS AND HERITAGE

FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL

STIMULATE THE ARTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY

ENCOURAGE DIVERSITY AND FAIR COMPETITION IN BROADCASTING

ACCELERATE THE GROWTH OF THE FILM AND TELEVISION INDUSTRY

ESTABLISH IRELAND AS A WORLD CENTRE FOR THE MUSIC INDUSTRY

GIVE A HIGH PRIORITY TO CONSERVING OUR HERITAGE
 
 
STIMULATING THE ARTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY

FIANNA F‡IL HAVE ALWAYS HAD AN ENLIGHTENED APPROACH TO THE ARTS. WE WILL 
CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT THE ARTS ARE PROPERLY FUNDED; AND IN PARTICULAR THAT WE 
CONTINUE TO BUILD UP THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY A VIBRANT INFRASTRUCTURE OF ARTS 
CENTRES, MUSEUMS AND THEATRES. 

TO STIMULATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARTS AT LOCAL LEVEL THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, 
WE WILL REQUIRE ALL LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO PRODUCE THREE-YEAR CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT 
PLANS. WE WILL ALSO REQUIRE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO SPEND A FIXED MINIMUM 
PROPORTION OF THEIR BUDGET ON CAPITAL PROJECTS RELATING TO THE ARTS.

WE WILL BY 1998 BRING ARTS COUNCIL FUNDING TO THE £26 MILLION TARGET SET OUT IN 
THE ARTS PLAN, A YEAR AHEAD OF THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENTIS SCHEDULE. WE WILL 
INTENSIFY EFFORTS TO OBTAIN EU FUNDING FOR THE ARTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH 
CROSS-BORDER OR STRONG EUROPEAN DIMENSIONS, AND PURSUE ALL OPPORTUNITIES UNDER 
EU CULTURAL AND TOURISM PROGRAMMES.

N WE WILL REQUIRE THE ARTS COUNCIL TO SHORTEN DECISION TIMES ON FUNDING 
APPLICATIONS AND TO INTRODUCE A FEEDBACK SCHEME FOR UNSUCCESSFUL APPLICANTS.






N WE WILL REQUIRE THE ARTS COUNCIL TO GIVE GREATER CONSIDERATION TO THE DISABLED 
ARTS.

N THE REGIONS WILL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN MAKING APPOINTMENTS TO THE ARTS 
COUNCIL.

N A NATIONAL CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS COUNCIL WILL BE ESTABLISHED TO ACT AS A FORUM 
FOR DIRECT CONTACT AND DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE MINISTER FOR ARTS AND THE HERITAGE 
COUNCIL, THE ARTS COUNCIL,  AOSD‡NA, THE DIRECTORS OF THE NATIONAL CULTURAL 
INSTITUTIONS, ETC.

N FIANNA F‡IL WILL MAKE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY AND NATIONAL 
MUSEUM A PRIORITY.

N WE WILL REQUIRE THE NATIONAL CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS TO HAVE OUTREACH 
PROGRAMMES WITH THE COMMUNITY TO GIVE WIDER APPRECIATION OF THEIR ROLES AND 
WORK.

N WE WILL STREAMLINE THE ABBEY THEATREIS RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS PRINCIPAL 
SPONSOR, THE STATE. WE RECOGNISE THE NEED TO REVIEW THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE 
FUNDING OF THE NATIONAL THEATRE, WITH REFERENCE TO CURRENT FUNDING 
ARRANGEMENTS FOR OTHER NATIONAL CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE NATIONAL 
CONCERT HALL AND IMMA.

N WE WILL FUND A SURVEY TO DETERMINE FUTURE STRATEGY FOR THEATRE DEVELOPMENT.

N WE SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT IN DUBLIN OF A CENTRE FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS, WITH 
A CONSERVATOIRE AT ITS CORE. MUSIC, DANCE, COMEDY, OPERA AND OTHER ARTS WOULD 
HAVE A PLACE AT THE CENTRE. WHILE THE CAPITAL COSTS AND SUSTAINABILITY OF THE 
VENTURE WILL HAVE TO BE CAREFULLY EXAMINED, FIANNA F‡IL IS IN FAVOUR OF SUCH A 
MAJOR INITIATIVE, ESPECIALLY AS A MILLENNIUM-TYPE PROJECT.

ENCOURAGING DIVERSITY AND FAIR COMPETITION IN BROADCASTING

WE WILL IMPLEMENT LEGISLATION TO PROTECT MAJOR DOMESTIC SPORTING EVENTS FOR 
VIEWING ON RTŽ AND TV3.  WE WILL GIVE TEILIF'S NA GAEILGE STATUTORY INDEPENDENCE 
AND FREEDOM TO ADD TO ITS BROADCASTING HOURS. WE WILL PROVIDE IT WITH SEPARATE 
FUNDING, AND WORK TO OVERCOME THE PRESENT RECEPTION PROBLEMS. WE WILL HOLD A 
PUBLIC COMPETITION FOR THE UNUSED HOURS OF TRANSMISSION TIME ON TNAG.
       
 WE WILL ENSURE THAT RTŽ PUTS GREATER EMPHASIS ON REGIONAL COVERAGE IN NEWS AND 
PROGRAMMES AND PROVIDE MORE TELEVISION DRAMA, DOCUMENTARIES AND COVERAGE OF THE 
ARTS.

CREATING THE RIGHT STRUCTURES. 
WE WILL NOT CREATE THE CUMBERSOME BROADCASTING MEGA-AUTHORITY PROPOSED BY THE 
RAINBOW 
GOVERNMENT, AS WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BLUR THE DESIRABLE DEMARCATION BETWEEN PUBLIC 
SERVICE BROADCASTING AND THE INDEPENDENT COMMERCIAL 
SECTOR. 

TO ANSWER THE REAL NEEDS OF THE SECTOR, WE WILL INSTEAD SET UP A NEW 
BROADCASTING ADVISORY COUNCIL  TO ADVISE ON CHANGES IN LEGISLATION, DEVELOPMENT 
OF LOCAL RADIO, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, FOREIGN COMPETITION AND THE RAPIDLY 
DEVELOPING PAY-PER-VIEW PHENOMENON IN TELEVISION SPORTS BROADCASTING.

ENCOURAGING COMPETITION. WE SUPPORT COMPETITION IN BROADCASTING, AND WE WANT TV3 
TO SUCCEED. WE WILL ENSURE THAT RTŽ RESPONDS FAIRLY TO THE NEW STATION. EQUALLY, 
WE SUPPORT THE NEW NATIONAL RADIO SERVICE AND WISH IT SUCCESS. WE WILL ESTABLISH 
ARBITRATION FOR DISPUTES BETWEEN COMMERCIAL OPERATORS AND RTŽ OVER TRANSMISSION 
FACILITIES AND COSTS. UNDER FIANNA F‡IL RTŽ WILL REMAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS 
TRANSMISSION FACILITIES, AS WE BELIEVE THAT HIVING THEM OFF TO A SEPARATE BODY 
WOULD BE INEFFICIENT AND WASTEFUL.

ON THE MMDS CONTROVERSY, FIANNA F‡IL HAVE HAD DETAILED DISCUSSIONS WITH BOTH THE 
COMMUNITY TV REPRESENTATIVES AND THE MMDS COMPANIES. WE BELIEVE THAT IF THE 
COMPLICATED LEGAL AND TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES CAN BE RESOLVED, PROVISION SHOULD 
BE MADE FOR LICENSING BOTH SYSTEMS. WE ARE IN FAVOUR OF FAIR COMPETITION IN THE 
AREA, AND IN GOVERNMENT WILL MOVE URGENTLY TO RESOLVE THE ISSUES.

FOSTERING INDEPENDENT RADIO. WE BELIEVE THAT A THRIVING INDEPENDENT RADIO SECTOR 
IS A VITAL PART OF THE NATIONAL MEDIA MIX, AND WE WILL ENSURE THAT IT DOES NOT 
HAVE TO LABOUR UNDER ANY SPECIAL HANDICAPS.

THE INDEPENDENT RADIO SECTOR PAYS A LEVY OF 3 PER CENT OF ITS ANNUAL INCOME TO 
THE IRTC TO FIND THE COMMISSIONIS COSTS. AS RECOMMENDED IN OUR DOCUMENT ON 
BROADCASTING, WE WILL ABOLISH THIS LEVY, AND THE IRTC WILL BE DIRECTLY FUNDED BY 
THE EXCHEQUER.

FIANNA F‡IL WILL SUPPORT FURTHER PROGRAMME DEVELOPMENT SCHEMES FOR LOCAL RADIO. 
THIS WILL BE FOR PUBLIC SERVICE BROADCASTING AND PROGRAMME DEVELOPMENT. GRANTS 
FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND FUNDING FOR ON-GOING COSTS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE 
WHERE LOCAL STATIONS HAVE TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN MULTIPLE TRANSMISSION SITES. 
THE EXCHEQUER WILL ALLOCATE A FUND OF £500,000 FOR THIS PURPOSE.  

WE WILL REQUIRE F‡S TO WORK WITH THE RADIO SECTOR TO DEVELOP TRAINING 
PROGRAMMES. 



ACCELERATING GROWTH IN THE FILM AND 
TELEVISION INDUSTRY

A SCREEN COMMISSION WILL BE SET UP TO CONTINUE 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INDUSTRY. WE WILL REVIEW THE FILM BOARD WITH A VIEW TO 
GIVING IT A BROADER AND MORE RELEVANT REMIT. WE BELIEVE THE BOARD SHOULD BE 
INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING TELEVISION DRAMA, BE MORE ACTIVE IN SALES AND MARKETING, 
AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, THROUGH THE SCREEN COMMISSION, FOR PUBLICISING IRELAND 
AS A LOCATION FOR INTERNATIONAL FILM MAKERS.

WE WILL REQUIRE THE FILM BOARD TO ENCOURAGE CO-PRODUCTION BETWEEN IRISH AND 
EUROPEAN PRODUCERS. AT PRESENT, IRELAND HAS ONLY ONE CO-PRODUCTION TREATY, WITH 
CANADA. THE BOARD WILL ALSO WORK CLOSELY WITH RTŽ IN ENCOURAGING THE INDEPENDENT 
SECTOR.

RESTORING THE CATALYST OF TAX INCENTIVES. FIANNA F‡IL WILL EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF 
THE RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON SECTION 35 BY THE RAINBOW GOVERNMENT. OUR INTENTION 
IS TO EXTEND THESE PROVISIONS RATHER THAN TO RESTRICT THEM, AS WE BELIEVE THEY 
ARE A POWERFUL STIMULUS TO THE FILM INDUSTRY. WE WILL ALSO BRING IN A NEW TAX 
RELIEF FOR SCRIPT AND PROJECT DEVELOPMENT. WE WILL ARRANGE FOR THE REVENUE 
COMMISSIONERS TO ISSUE A STATEMENT OF PRACTICE FOR THE FILM INDUSTRY, TO AVOID 
THE UNCERTAINTY THAT CURRENTLY ARISES FROM DIFFERING PRACTICES BY INDIVIDUAL 
INSPECTORS.

AN INDUSTRY THINK-TANK THAT EMBRACES ALL. THERE IS A CLEAR NEED FOR AN INDUSTRY 
THINK-TANK THAT WILL SET POLICY AND MONITOR ONGOING DEVELOPMENTS.AT THE MOMENT, 
THE NEAREST BODY TO THIS IS THE COMMITTEE OF STATE AGENCIES WITH 
RESPONSIBILITIES AFFECTING FILM AND TELEVISION. FIANNA F‡IL WILL ABOLISH THIS 
COMMITTEE AND REPLACE IT WITH AN INDUSTRY-WIDE THINK-TANK WITH REPRESENTATION 
FROM ALL. IN ORDER TO STIMULATE 
THE WIDEST POSSIBLE DEBATE, THE NEW BODY WILL PUBLISH PROMPTLY THE OUTCOME OF 
ITS MEETINGS.

EDUCATING FOR FILM. FIANNA F‡IL WILL DRAW UP A NEW FILM TRAINING AND EDUCATION 
PLAN. ELEMENTS OF THIS WILL INCLUDE:

N EXAMINING THE FEASIBILITY OF SETTING UP IN IRELAND A FILM SCHOOL OF WORLD 
CLASS, WHICH WOULD ATTRACT INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AND PROVIDE THE BEST POSSIBLE 
TRAINING FOR IRISH PEOPLE. SUCH A SCHOOL COULD POSSIBLY BE A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN 
THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS.

N ENCOURAGING CLOSER CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE FILM AND TELEVISION INDUSTRY AND 
COLLEGES OFFERING COURSES RELATED TO IT.

N CREATING A MIX OF SHORT COURSES AND WORKSHOPS TO DEAL WITH CREATIVE AND 
ENTREPRENEURIAL DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING FOR TECHNICIANS.

ESTABLISHING IRELAND AS A WORLD CENTRE FOR THE MUSIC INDUSTRY

FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE THAT IRELAND HAS SIGNIFICANT COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES IN THE 
TALENT AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF ITS MUSIC INDUSTRY. THERE IS ENORMOUS FURTHER 
POTENTIAL FOR IRELAND AS A WORLD-CLASS INTERNATIONAL MUSIC CENTRE, EXTENDING OUR 
ACTIVITIES INTO ALL ASPECTS OF THIS RAPIDLY-CHANGING GLOBAL INDUSTRY.

FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE THAT IRELAND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME A WORLD CENTRE FOR 
THE PRODUCTION, STORAGE AND ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION WORLD WIDE, OF MUSIC.  

WE ENVISAGE A BROADLY-BASED INDUSTRY, EXTENDING NOT ONLY TO THE CREATION AND 
PERFORMANCE OF ALL KINDS OF MUSIC, BUT ALSO TO THE BUSINESS SIDE  SUCH AS 
TREASURY OPERATIONS, DATA PROCESSING, TELESALES, COMPLETION OF RECORD AND 
PUBLISHING DEALS, LEGAL SERVICES.

WHAT WE DID FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES IN 1987, WE NOW PROPOSE FOR THE MUSIC 
INDUSTRY IN 1997. FIANNA F‡IL WILL INJECT THE SAME DYNAMISM TO THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF IRELAND AS AN INTERNATIONAL MUSIC CENTRE AS WE DID TO THE IFSC. 

OUR POLICY WILL BE TYPIFIED BY HARNESSING THE ENERGIES OF THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC 
SECTORS, BY A WILLINGNESS TO PASS QUICKLY THE NECESSARY LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO 
UNDERPIN THE STRATEGY, AND BY EFFECTIVE PROFESSIONAL PROMOTION.

WHAT IS NOW NEEDED IS A POLITICAL DRIVING FORCE TO ANIMATE ALL THESE DISPARATE 
ELEMENTS, AS PART OF A NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR THE MUSIC INDUSTRY. FIANNA F‡IL 
WILL PROVIDE THAT DRIVING FORCE. RECENT FIGURES SHOW THE IRISH MUSIC INDUSTRY 
HAS AN OUTPUT VALUE OF ABOUT £160 MILLION AND EMPLOYS 10,000 PEOPLE (FULL-TIME 
EQUIVALENTS). 

AMONG THE ELEMENTS NEEDED ARE:

N A NATIONAL CENTRE FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS

N WORLD CLASS RESIDENTIAL RECORDING STUDIOS

N DIGITAL MUSIC LIBRARIES CAPABLE OF DISTRIBUTING MUSIC AND VISUAL MATERIAL 
INTERNATIONALLY

N A CAMPAIGN TO ATTRACT WORLD CLASS PRODUCERS AND PERFORMERS TO IRELAND.

FIANNA F‡IL WILL, IMMEDIATELY ON ENTERING GOVERNMENT, SET UP A MUSIC BOARD WITH 
OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPLEMENTING THE MUSIC INDUSTRY STRATEGY. MEMBERSHIP 
WILL INCLUDE THE KEY CONTRIBUTORS TO THE STRATEGY FROM BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE 
SECTORS.
GIVING A HIGH PRIORITY TO CONSERVING OUR HERITAGE

IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE DEVOTED CONSIDERABLE NATIONAL EFFORT AND RESOURCES TO 
STIMULATING THE ARTS IN IRELAND  WITH SPECTACULAR RESULTS. FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE 
THAT THE TIME HAS NOW COME TO GIVE A HIGHER PRIORITY TO CONSERVING OUR 
HERITAGE. WE SEE STIMULATING THE ARTS AND CONSERVING OUR HERITAGE AS TWO 
ESSENTIAL 
ELEMENTS OF AN OVERALL CULTURAL POLICY.

WE WILL

N DEVELOP A NATIONAL HERITAGE PLAN, AND REQUIRE EACH LOCAL AUTHORITY TO 
DEVELOP A HERITAGE PLAN TO COMPLEMENT THE NATIONAL STRATEGY.

N ALLOCATE A SPECIFIC PROPORTION OF LOTTERY FUNDING TO HERITAGE.

N EXAMINE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE 
COMMERCIAL SECTOR ON FUNDING OF HERITAGE, AND ASSESS THE NEED FOR ANY 
SPECIAL TAX INCENTIVES.

N SET UP A  NATIONAL STATUTORY INVENTORY OF ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE.

N RE-ESTABLISH THE INDEPENDENCE AND STATUS OF THE CHIEF HERALD AND ALLOW MAXIMUM 
PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE GENEALOGICAL OFFICE.

N DEVELOP A STRATEGY FOR A NATIONAL MUSEUMS SERVICE. 

N PUT IN PLACE A REVOLVING FUND FOR HERITAGE TOWNS, SO THEY CAN PROVIDE MATCHING 
FUNDS FOR INITIATIVES TO PRESERVE AND ENHANCE THEIR HERITAGE.

N ENCOURAGE THE SETTING UP OF LOCAL HERITAGE COMMITTEES TO ACT AS ADVISORY 
GROUPS FOR LOCAL AUTHORITIES.

N PUT IN PLACE A FULLY-TRANSPARENT SYSTEM OF CONSULTATION AND COMPENSATION IN 
RELATION TO THE DESIGNATION OF SPECIAL PROTECTION AREAS AND SPECIAL AREAS OF 
CONSERVATION. 

N REVIEW THE POSITION OF THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES IN THE LIGHT OF THE NEW 
CHALLENGES IT FACES UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT. WE WILL REINSTATE THE 
RESOURCES FOR NATIONAL WOMENIS ARCHIVE AND RESOURCE CENTRE. AN OUTREACH 
PROGRAMME BY THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES WILL HELP PUBLIC BODIES, 
CHURCHES, POLITICAL PARTIES, IN MAINTAINING RECORDS. THE LOCAL AUTHORITY 
ARCHIVAL SERVICE WILL ALSO BE IMPROVED.

N WE WILL PROVIDE A PACKAGE OF TAX INCENTIVES FOR REFURBISHMENT OF GEORGIAN 
HOUSES FOR RESIDENTIAL PURPOSES.

STRENGTHENING IRELAND'S PLACE IN THE WORLD
      

RESTORING THE PEACE PROCESS

PLAYING A MORE EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL ROLE
 
MODERNISING OUR DEFENCE FORCES
       
      






























RESTORING THE PEACE PROCESS

FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL

WORK TO RE-ESTABLISH THE PEACE PROCESS AND MAKE IT IRREVERSIBLE 

PROMOTE A UNIVERSAL COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES 
   
DEEPEN FURTHER OUR VALUABLE LINKS WITH ALL SIDES OF THE COMMUNITY IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND 

ENCOURAGE MEASURES TO DEVELOP CONFIDENCE AND TO BUILD ECONOMIC BRIDGES TO PEACE 


BUILDING PEACE FROM A DEMOCRATIC CONSENSUS 

FIANNA F‡IL WILL AIM TO INJECT NEW POLITICAL MOMENTUM INTO AN INCLUSIVE NORTHERN 
TALKS PROCESS, TO ENSURE THAT THE ELECTORAL MANDATE OF ALL PARTIES THAT HAVE 
RENOUNCED VIOLENCE FOR GOOD IS FULLY RESPECTED. 

WE WILL WORK TOWARDS A CLOSER, MORE PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BRITISH 
GOVERNMENT. WE WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE ANGLO-IRISHAGREEMENT AS AN INSTRUMENT 
FOR PROMOTING EQUALITY, PARITY OF ESTEEM AND INSTITUTIONAL REFORM, UNTIL A NEW, 
MORE COMPREHENSIVE AGREEMENT TAKES ITS PLACE. 

WE WILL DEEPEN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH UNIONISTS AND NATIONALISTS, USING THE 
CHANNELS WE DEVELOPED IN 1993-94 AND HAVE SOUGHT TO BUILD ON WHILE IN 
OPPOSITION. 

FIANNA F‡IL'S APPROACH TO A SOLUTION IN NORTHERN IRELAND WILL REMAIN FIRMLY 
BASED ON THE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE IRISH AND BRITISH GOVERNMENTS ENSHRINED IN 
THE DOWNING STREET DECLARATION OF 1993 AND THE FRAMEWORK DOCUMENT OF 
1995,TOGETHER WITH THE CONSENSUS BETWEEN ALMOST ALL PARTIES REFLECTED IN THE 
DRAFT REPORT OF THE FORUM FOR PEACE AND RECONCILIATION. KEY TO THIS APPROACH IS 
A TOTAL COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, ACOMMITMENT WHICH WE WILL WORK TO 
HAVE ACCEPTED BY ALL ON THIS ISLAND.

AS SOON AS PEACE IS RESTORED, FIANNA F‡IL WILL REASSEMBLE THE FORUM FOR PEACE 
AND RECONCILIATION. 



BUILDING CONFIDENCE ON ALL SIDES 

FIANNA F‡IL  WILL ENCOURAGE CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURES, TO DEVELOP MORE TRUST 
BETWEEN THE COMMUNITIES IN THE NORTH AND BETWEEN THE NORTH AND SOUTH OF IRELAND. 
IN DOING THIS WE WILL FOCUS ON CULTURAL IDENTITY, HUMAN RIGHTS, ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT IN AREAS OF DEPRIVATION, AND ISSUES
OF EQUALITY AND PARITY OF ESTEEM. 

IN CONDITIONS OF PEACE, WE WILL CONSIDER SEEKING, IN CO-OPERATION WITH A NEW 
BRITISH GOVERNMENT, AN INDEPENDENT INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION TO ESTABLISH THE 
TRUTH IN REGARD TO SOME OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL INCIDENTS OF THE TROUBLES, 
WHETHER THE PERPETRATORS WERE GOVERNMENTAL OR PARAMILITARY ORGANISATIONS. 

WE WILL PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE SITUATION OF POLITICALLY MOTIVATED 
PRISONERS, WHETHER REPUBLICAN OR LOYALIST, RECOGNISING THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS AS 
A KEY CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURE. 

BUILDING ECONOMIC BRIDGES TO PEACE 

THE PEACE PROCESS AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED: A MORE 
PROSPEROUS AND PEACEFUL IRELAND WILL FACILITATE THE LONG-TERM RESOLUTION OF 
POLITICAL PROBLEMS, WHILE REAL POLITICAL PROGRESS WOULD GALVANISE THE ECONOMIES 
OF BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH. 

WITH THIS IN MIND, FIANNA F‡IL WILL GIVE SPECIAL PRIORITY TO RAISING THE LEVEL 
OF NORTH-SOUTH ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION, WHERE IT IS TO CLEAR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE. 
AREAS OF KEY OPPORTUNITY ARE TOURISM, CULTURE,TRANSPORT, ENERGY, AGRICULTURE, 
MARINE AND INLAND WATERWAYS. INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FROM THE EU AND OTHERS WILL 
BE FULLY HARNESSED TO DEVELOP NEW PROJECTS IN THE DUBLIN-BELFAST ECONOMIC 
CORRIDOR AND ALONG THE BORDER ON BOTH SIDES. WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE IDA AND THE 
IDB TO WORK TOGETHER TO ATTRACT INWARD INVESTMENT TOWARDS EMPLOYMENT BLACK SPOTS 
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER. WE ARE ALSO PREPARED TO EXTEND EQUAL TREATMENT TO 
SUPPLIERS FROM NORTHERN IRELAND IN THE LINKAGE PROGRAMMES FOR OVERSEAS COMPANIES 
ESTABLISHED HERE, AS WELL AS IN PUBLIC SECTOR TENDER INVITATIONS, PROVIDED 
RECIPROCAL ARRANGEMENTS CAN BE AGREED WITH THE NORTHERN AUTHORITIES.
       
       







PLAYING A MORE EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL ROLE

FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL

PURSUE A POLICY OF CONSTRUCTIVE MILITARY NEUTRALITY - PARTICIPATING
ACTIVELY IN PEACEKEEPING AND HUMANITARIAN MISSIONS, WHILE REJECTING
ALL INVOLVEMENT WITH NUCLEAR-BASED ALLIANCES 

WORK TOWARDS A FRESH VISION FOR AN EXPANDED EUROPE  

MOBILISE THE EU ON THE LINKED THREATS OF DRUGS AND INTERNATIONAL CRIME

WORK TO MODERNISE THE UNITED NATIONS 

BUILD UP TO A MINIMUM OF 0.45% OF GNP IN DEVELOPMENT AID OVER 5 YEARS - MORE IF 
ECONOMIC PROGRESS ALLOWS  

MAKE HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS A PRIORITY 

FOCUS IRELAND'S REPRESENTATION ABROAD MORE CLOSELY ON SUPPORTING OVERALL 
NATIONAL OBJECTIVES
      
      
A CONSTRUCTIVE NEUTRALITY

FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE IN THE POSITIVE VALUE OF IRELAND'S HONOURABLE TRADITION OF 
MILITARY NEUTRALITY.  WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF NEUTRALITY, FIANNA F‡IL ARE 
COMMITTED TO MAKING AN ACTIVE CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF COLLECTIVE 
SECURITY THROUGH INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS THE UN AND THE ORGANISATION 
FOR SECURITY CO-OPERATION IN EUROPE. WE FAVOUR MAKING IRISH TROOPS AVAILABLE TO 
THE EU ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS FOR PEACEKEEPING AND HUMANITARIAN MISSIONS. 

FIANNA F‡IL ARE COMMITTED TO NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT. WE WILL OPPOSE ANY MOVES TO 
EDGE IRELAND CLOSER TO MEMBERSHIP OF AN ALLIANCE STILL COMMITTED TO THE 
DEPLOYMENT AND USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. WE OPPOSE IRISH PARTICIPATION IN NATO 
ITSELF, IN NATO-LED ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE, OR IN THE 
WESTERN EUROPEAN UNION BEYOND OBSERVER STATUS. FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL 
NOT PARTICIPATE IN ANY CO-OPERATIVE SECURITY STRUCTURE WHICH HAS IMPLICATIONS 
FOR IRISH NEUTRALITY WITHOUT FIRST CONSULTING THE PEOPLE THROUGH A REFERENDUM.
IN LINE WITH OUR POLICY OF CONSTRUCTIVE NEUTRALITY, FIANNA F‡IL ARE OPPOSED TO 
ANY PLANS TO SET UP WITHIN THE STRUCTURE OF THE EU ANY ORGANISATION (SUCH AS THE 
WESTERN EUROPEAN ARMAMENTS GROUP) WHICH AIMS TO BOOST RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
INTO WEAPONRY, FACILITATE THE INTERNATIONAL ARMS INDUSTRY, OR PLACE ARMS 
CONTRACTS. INSTEAD, WE WILL PROMOTE PROJECTS TO DEVELOP NON-MILITARY INDUSTRY IN 
AREAS OF EUROPE THREATENED BY UNEMPLOYMENT DUE TO THE SHRINKING ARMS TRADE. WE 
WILL ALSO WORK TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT NUCLEAR INSPECTORATE AT EU LEVEL. 

MOBILISING EUROPE AGAINST DRUGS AND INTERNATIONAL CRIME 

FIANNA F‡IL BROUGHT IRELAND INTO THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY. WE BELIEVE THAT 
IRELAND'S FUTURE LIES IN ENTHUSIASTIC MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. FIANNA 
F‡IL WILL STRIVE TO ACHIEVE A FRESH VISION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AS A POLITICAL 
AND ECONOMIC COMMUNITY, RATHER THAN A MILITARY SUPERPOWER OR A FEDERAL 
SUPERSTATE. 

FIANNA F‡IL FAVOUR THE PHASED ENLARGEMENT OF THE EU, TO ENHANCE BOTH THE 
STABILITY AND PROSPERITY OF EUROPE. WE WILL DEFEND THE PRESENT INSTITUTIONAL 
BALANCE WITHIN THE EU, PARTICULARLY THE GUARANTEE THAT EACH MEMBER STATE HAS A 
COMMISSIONER, AS VITAL TO IRELAND'S INTERESTS. FIANNA F‡IL UPHOLD THE PRINCIPLE 
OF SUBSIDIARITY, WHICH ENCOURAGES ISSUES TO BE DEALT WITH AT THE MOST 
APPROPRIATE LEVEL - EUROPEAN, NATIONAL, REGIONAL OR LOCAL. WE ALSO BELIEVE THE 
EU MUST MOVE CLOSER TO ITS CITIZENS, NOT LEAST BY RIDDING ITSELF OF BUREAUCRATIC 
JARGON. 

FIANNA F‡IL WILL ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW AND INNOVATIVE COMMON 
FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY, DESIGNED WITH THE PRIORITY OF TACKLING DRUG-
TRAFFICKING AND THE GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL CRIME. DRUGS AND INTERNATIONAL CRIME 
ARE A LINKED CHALLENGE THAT THREATEN ALL EU MEMBERS - A CHALLENGE THAT REQUIRES 
MORE CONCERTED AND SUSTAINED EUROPEAN ACTION THAN IT HAS YET RECEIVED. 

IN CHAMPIONING SUCH ACTION, FIANNA F‡IL WILL PRESS FOR AN ENHANCED ROLE FOR 
EUROPOL, BASED ON BETTER EXCHANGE OF INTELLIGENCE BETWEEN NATIONAL POLICE 
FORCES; TIGHTER CONTROL OF THE EU'S EXTERNAL BORDERS; MORE EFFECTIVE ACTION 
AGAINST TRANS-NATIONAL MONEY LAUNDERING; AND THE POOLING OF KNOWLEDGE AND 
RESEARCH ON DRUGS. WE WILL VIGOROUSLY OPPOSE ANY MOVE AT EUROPEAN LEVEL TO 
LEGALISE DRUGS.

MODERNISING THE UN 

FIANNA F‡IL ARE COMMITTED TO ENHANCING IRELAND'S POSITIVE ROLE IN THE UNITED 
NATIONS, PARTICULARLY THROUGH PEACEKEEPING. FIANNA F‡IL ALSO RECOGNISE THAT THE 
UN URGENTLY NEEDS TO BE MODERNISED IF IT IS TO REMAIN RELEVANT IN A CHANGING 
WORLD. FIANNA F‡IL WILL PROPOSE: 



N SPEEDING UP THE UN'S RESPONSE CAPACITY, PARTICULARLY TO HUMANITARIAN 
DISASTERS, THROUGH EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS AND MORE FLEXIBLE PEACEKEEPING AND 
MEDIATION TOOLS, 

N A RADICAL OVERHAUL OF UN FUNDING, INCLUDING COLLECTION OF ARREARS, 

N  DEVELOPING CLOSER RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UN AND NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS, 

N ESTABLISHING A UN ECONOMIC SECURITY COUNCIL, AND 

N  ESTABLISHING A PERMANENT INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT, WITH 
JURISDICTION OVER WAR CRIMES, INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, 
ENVIRONMENTAL CRIME, INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND DRUGS. 

A COHERENT APPROACH TO GLOBAL ISSUES 

FIANNA F‡IL WILL PURSUE A FOREIGN POLICY THAT COHERENTLY ADDRESSES THE KEY 
GLOBAL ISSUES THAT REFLECT THE VALUES AND CONCERNS OF IRISH PEOPLE. 

DEVELOPMENT AID. FIANNA F‡IL WILL AIM TO DONATE, AS A MINIMUM, 0.45% OF GNP IN 
OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE BY 2002. THIS WILL BRING IRELAND WELL ABOVE THE 
PRESENT AVERAGE OECD DONATION. IF ECONOMIC GROWTH OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS 
MATCHES THAT OF THE LAST FIVE, WE MAY BE ABLE TO DO BETTER - WORKING TOWARDS THE 
EVENTUAL
TARGET OF 0.7% OF GNP, WHICH WE UNRESERVEDLY ACCEPT AS A LONG-TERM COMMITMENT. 
FIANNA F‡IL BELIEVE IRISH PEOPLE ARE WILLING - AND INDEED ANXIOUS - TO SHARE OUR 
INCREASING PROSPERITY WITH THOSE WHO ARE LESS FORTUNATE. 

HUMAN RIGHTS. FIANNA F‡IL WILL MAKE THE ACTIVE AND PRACTICAL VINDICATION OF 
HUMAN RIGHTS IN ALL ITS FORMS A PRIORITY IN GOVERNMENT. WE WILL WORK TO IMPOSE 
SANCTIONS AGAINST THOSE WHO BREACH INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS CONVENTIONS. WE 
REGARD REFORM OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AS AN URGENT PRIORITY, SO AS 
TO COPPER-FASTEN THE COURT'S ROLE AND SPEED UP ITS PROCEEDINGS. AT HOME, WE WILL 
SEEK TO INCORPORATE THE HUMAN RIGHTS CONVENTION INTO DOMESTIC LAW, IN A WAY THAT 
DOES NOT IN ANY WAY DIMINISH CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. WE WILL SET UP A 
INTERDEPARTMENTAL STANDING COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RIGHTS, TO KEEP HUMAN RIGHTS 
CONCERNS TO THE FOREFRONT IN ALL GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS. 

CHILD WELFARE. FIANNA F‡IL WILL PROMOTE CO-ORDINATED INTERNATIONAL ACTION 
AGAINST CHILD PROSTITUTION AND EXPLOITATION OF CHILD LABOUR. (WE INTRODUCED 
BILLS ON THESE ISSUES WHILE IN OPPOSITION.) 



DEVELOPING COUNTRIES' DEBT. FIANNA F‡IL WILL WORK TO CONVENE A WORLD CONFERENCE 
TO SECURE A COMPLETE WRITE-OFF OF THE DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF THE LESS DEVELOPED 
COUNTRIES.

DEADLY WEAPONS. FIANNA F‡IL WILL PUSH FOR AN OUTRIGHT, WORLDWIDE BAN ON ALL 
TYPES OF ANTI-PERSONNEL LANDMINES (IN LINE WITH THE DOMESTIC BILL WE INTRODUCED 
WHILE IN OPPOSITION). 

FOCUSING IRELAND'S REPRESENTATION ABROAD 

FIANNA F‡IL WILL REFINE THE OBJECTIVES OF OUR DIPLOMATIC 
REPRESENTATIVES, ENHANCING THEIR ROLE IN SUPPORTING THE NATION'S GOALS. 

WE BELIEVE, FOR INSTANCE, THAT THE PURSUIT OF IRISH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT RANKS 
EQUALLY IN STATUS WITH TRADITIONAL DIPLOMATIC WORK. WE WILL FOSTER BETTER CO-
ORDINATION BETWEEN STATE AGENCIES, THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND OUR REPRESENTATION 
ABROAD. WE WILL EXPAND THE "IRELAND HOUSE" CONCEPT, WHICH BRINGS TOGETHER UNDER 
ONE ROOF THE OVERSEAS OFFICES OF DIFFERENT IRISH ORGANISATIONS. 

WE  WILL ALSO ENHANCE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH IRISH PEOPLE LIVING ABROAD: THIS 
WILL EXTEND TO PRE-EMIGRATION ADVICE AND COUNSELLING, AND CLOSER LIAISON WITH 
EMIGRANTS AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVES.

MODERNISING OUR 
DEFENCE FORCES

FIANNA F‡IL IN GOVERNMENT WILL 

PREPARE A WHITE PAPER ON DEFENCE POLICY WITHIN ONE YEAR

CREATE AND IMPLEMENT A 10-YEAR STRATEGIC PLAN FOR THE DEFENCE FORCES, REPLACING 
THE SHORT-TERM DECISION-MAKING NOW IN PLACE 

EQUIP OUR FORCES ADEQUATELY FOR AN EXPANDED ROLE IN INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING 

REDEFINE AND ENHANCE THE ROLE OF THE AIR CORPS, THE NAVAL SERVICE AND THE FCA 

REBUILD DAMAGED MORALE THROUGH GENUINE CONSULTATION AND A POLICY OF OPENNESS
      
      
NEEDED: A CLEAR SENSE OF DIRECTION

SERIOUS PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN BUILDING UP IN OUR DEFENCE FORCES, CAUSED BY A LACK 
OF LONG-TERM PLANNING. THESE INCLUDE: 

N THE AVERAGE AGE OF SOLDIERS IS TOO HIGH, DUE IN THE MAIN TO A STOP-GO 
RECRUITING POLICY.

N THERE IS AN IMBALANCE BETWEEN SPENDING ON PAY AND OTHER RESOURCES, WITH 
PAYROLL ACCOUNTING FOR 80%. 

N THERE IS NOT ENOUGH UP-TO-DATE EQUIPMENT, ESPECIALLY FOR INTERNATIONAL 
PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS.

N THERE IS AN INABILITY TO CARRY OUT SUB-UNIT AND UNIT COLLECTIVE TRAINING. 

N SOLDIERS ON SECURITY DUTIES ARE WORKING EXTREMELY LONG HOURS. 



N MORALE HAS BEEN DAMAGED BY THE ABSENCE OF A CLEAR DIRECTION FOR THE FUTURE,AND 
WORSENED BY THE LACK OF OPENNESS AND PROPER CONSULTATION BY
THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT. 

OUR COMMITMENT IS TO A LONG-TERM APPROACH 

FIANNA F‡IL CONSIDER IT ESSENTIAL THAT A DEFENCE POLICY IS FORMULATED TO CREATE 
STRONG, EFFICIENT AND COST-EFFECTIVE DEFENCE FORCES WITH TIMELY INVESTMENT IN 
CAPITAL, EQUIPMENT AND TRAINING. 

FIANNA F‡IL, IN OUR FIRST YEAR IN GOVERNMENT, WILL PREPARE A WHITE PAPER ON 
DEFENCE POLICY.  THIS WILL SET OUT A DETAILED STRATEGIC PLAN, WITH A 
COMPREHENSIVE 10-YEAR PROGRAMME OF REFORM COVERING THE KEY AREAS OF PERSONNEL, 
EQUIPMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE. ELEMENTS OF THE PLAN WILL INCLUDE:

N DELEGATING ALL DAY-TO-DAY ADMINISTRATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE TO THE 
BRANCHES OF THE DEFENCE FORCES THEMSELVES. 

N CONTINUOUS RECRUITING, TO REPLACE THE DISASTROUS STOP-GO POLICY. WE WILL 
RECRUIT 1,500 NEW PERSONNEL OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.

N ENCOURAGING WOMEN TO ENTER ALL BRANCHES OF THE DEFENCE FORCES, AND
  FUNDING THE FACILITIES NECESSARY FOR THEIR FULL PARTICIPATION. 

EXPANDING THE INTERNATIONAL ROLE 

THE IRISH PEOPLE ARE IMMENSELY PROUD OF OUR DEFENCE FORCES, AND NOWHERE IS THIS 
MORE EMPHATICALLY THE CASE THAN IN THE SERVICE OF OUR PEACE-KEEPING TROOPS IN 
FAR-FLUNG FIELDS UNDER THE BANNER OF THE UNITED NATIONS. SERVICE IN THE UN IS 
ALSO A
CRUCIAL ELEMENT IN THE TRAINING REQUIREMENT AND MORALE OF THE FORCE. 

BUT IN SOME INSTANCES, DUE TO LACK OF RESOURCES, IRISH TROOPS CAN PROVIDE ONLY A 
TOKEN INVOLVEMENT. 

FIANNA F‡IL WILL ENSURE THAT THE NECESSARY EQUIPMENT IS PURCHASED, OR IF 
NECESSARY LEASED, TO ENABLE OUR TROOPS TO TAKE PART IN A WIDER RANGE OF 
PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS, UNDER THE UN OR EU AUSPICES. 

FIANNA F‡IL WILL RATIFY THE CONVENTION FOR THE SAFETY OF UNITED NATIONS TROOPS 
AND ASSOCIATED PERSONNEL. 



A CLEARER ROLE FOR KEY BRANCHES

 AS PART OF OUR STRATEGIC PLAN, WE WILL REDEFINE AND ENHANCE THE ROLE OF 
INDIVIDUAL BRANCHES OF THE DEFENCE FORCES. 


N WE WILL BRING UP THE NAVAL SERVICE TO FULL STRENGTH, IN LINE WITH ITS 
INCREASING RESPONSIBILITIES IN PROTECTING OUR MARINE RESOURCES, IN DRUGS 
INTERDICTION AND IN POLLUTION CONTROL. WE ALSO RECOGNISE THE NEED TO ACQUIRE 
ADDITIONAL VESSELS. 

N WE WILL TREAT THE AIR CORPS AS A SEPARATE AUTONOMOUS ENTITY FOR THE PURPOSE OF 
PROMOTION, COMPETITION AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT, AS THE PRESENT STRUCTURE GIVES 
RISE TO SERIOUS PERSONNEL DIFFICULTIES AND CONSIDERABLE DISSATISFACTION. WE WILL 
REVIEW THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CONTRACTS, AND MAKE THE RETIREMENT AND RETENTION 
SYSTEM MORE FLEXIBLE.
      
N WE WILL GIVE THE FCA AN EXPANDED ROLE, REACHING INTO THE HEART OF
  ALL COMMUNITIES, AS PART OF THE NATION'S RESPONSE TO CRIMINALITY AND
  TERRORISM. 

REBUILDING MORALE THROUGH OPENNESS AND CONSULTATION 

FIANNA F‡IL RECOGNISE THAT THE MORALE OF ANY ARMED FORCES IS THE MOST IMPORTANT 
FACTOR IN MAINTAINING THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF TRAINING AND EFFICIENCY AMONG ALL 
RANKS. IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY IN TIME OF CHANGE, THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANS 
ARE OPEN AND THAT THE WIDEST POSSIBLE CONSULTATIONS TAKE PLACE WITH THE 
REPRESENTATIVE ORGANISATIONS OF THE DEFENCE FORCES BEFORE DECISIONS ARE TAKEN. 

THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED UNDER THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT, WHO SEEM UNAWARE OF 
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE IN THE DEFENCE FORCES. 

THE INTRODUCTION OF REPRESENTATIVE ASSOCIATIONS HAS BROADENED THE OUTLOOK OF 
MILITARY PERSONNEL. THE FORMER STRICTLY AUTHORITARIAN AMBIENCE HAS BEEN REPLACED 
BY A MORE CRITICAL QUESTIONING ATTITUDE, BASED NEVERTHELESS ON UNSWERVING 
LOYALTY TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THESTATE.PERSONNEL ARE DEMANDING MORE REGARD TO 
PERSONAL AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT, IN LINE WITH THEIR PEERS IN CIVILIAN LIFE. IT 
IS NO LONGER SATISFACTORY SIMPLY TO IMPOSE AUTHORITY AS A SUBSTITUTE. 

SO, IN PREPARING AND IMPLEMENTING OUR STRATEGIC PLAN FOR THE DEFENCE FORCES, 
FIANNA F‡IL WILL ENGAGE IN THE FULLEST POSSIBLE MEANINGFUL CONSULTATION BOTH 
WITH THE HEADS AND WITH THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE DEFENCE FORCES, TO PRODUCE 
THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME.
