\usage{
selectFeaturesOLD(x, ...)

\method{selectFeaturesOLD}{tokenizedTexts}(x, features, selection = c("keep",
  "remove"), valuetype = c("glob", "regex", "fixed"),
  case_insensitive = TRUE, verbose = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object whose features will be selected}

\item{...}{supplementary arguments passed to the underlying functions in 
\code{\link[stringi]{stri_detect_regex}}.  (This is how 
\code{case_insensitive} is passed, but you may wish to pass others.)}

\item{features}{one of: a character vector of features to be selected, a 
\link{dfm} whose features will be used for selection, or a dictionary class
object whose values (not keys) will provide the features to be selected. 
For \link{dfm} objects, see details in the Value section below.}

\item{selection}{whether to keep or remove the features}

\item{valuetype}{the type of pattern matching: \code{"glob"} for "glob"-style
wildcard expressions; \code{"regex"} for regular expressions;
\code{"fixed"} for exact matching; or \code{"charclass"} for character classes. 
See \link{valuetype} for details.}

\item{case_insensitive}{ignore the case of dictionary values if \code{TRUE}}

\item{verbose}{if \code{TRUE} print message about how many features were 
removed}
}
\description{
Calls C++ for super-fast selection or removal of features from a 
set of tokens.
