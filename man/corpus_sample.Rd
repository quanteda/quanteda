\title{randomly sample documents from a corpus}
\usage{
corpus_sample(x, size = ndoc(x), replace = FALSE, prob = NULL,
  by = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a corpus object whose documents will be sampled}

\item{size}{a positive number, the number of documents to select}

\item{replace}{Should sampling be with replacement?}

\item{prob}{A vector of probability weights for obtaining the elements of the
vector being sampled.}

\item{by}{a grouping variable for sampling.  Useful for resampling
sub-document units such as sentences, for instance by specifying \code{by =
"document"}}

\item{...}{unused}
}
\value{
A corpus object with number of documents equal to \code{size}, drawn 
  from the corpus \code{x}.  The returned corpus object will contain all of 
  the meta-data of the original corpus, and the same document variables for 
  the documents selected.
}
\description{
Takes a random sample or documents or features of the specified size from a 
corpus or document-feature matrix, with or without replacement.  Works just 
as \code{\link{sample}} works for the documents and their associated 
document-level variables.
}
\examples{
# sampling from a corpus
summary(corpus_sample(data_corpus_inaugural, 5)) 
summary(corpus_sample(data_corpus_inaugural, 10, replace=TRUE))

# sampling sentences within document
doccorpus <- corpus(c(one = "Sentence one.  Sentence two.  Third sentence.",
                      two = "First sentence, doc2.  Second sentence, doc2."))
sentcorpus <- corpus_reshape(doccorpus, to = "sentences")
texts(sentcorpus)
texts(corpus_sample(sentcorpus, replace = TRUE, by = 'documents'))
