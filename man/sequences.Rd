\usage{
sequences(x, features = "*", valuetype = c("glob", "regex", "fixed"),
  case_insensitive = TRUE, min_count = 2, max_size = 5, nested = TRUE,
  ordered = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \link{tokens} object}

\item{features}{a regular expression for filtering the features to be located
in sequences}

\item{valuetype}{how to interpret keyword expressions: \code{"glob"} for 
"glob"-style wildcard expressions; \code{"regex"} for regular expressions;
or \code{"fixed"} for exact matching. See \link{valuetype} for details.}

\item{case_insensitive}{ignore case when matching, if \code{TRUE}}

\item{min_count}{minimum frequency of sequences for which parameters are estimated}

\item{max_size}{maxium length of sequences which are collected}

\item{nested}{if true, collect all the subsequences of a longer sequence as separate entities.
e.g. in a sequence of capitalized words "United States Congress", "States Congress" is considered 
as a subsequence. But "United States" is not a subsequence because it is followed by "Congress".}

\item{ordered}{if true, use the Blaheta-Johnson method that distinguishs between 
the order of words, and tends to promote rare sequences.}
}
\description{
This function automatically identifies contiguous collocations consisting of
variable-length term sequences whose frequency is unlikey to have occurred by
chance.  The algorithm is based on Blaheta and Johnson's "Unsupervised 
Learning of Multi-Word Verbs".
