\usage{
dfm_select(
  x,
  pattern = NULL,
  selection = c("keep", "remove"),
  valuetype = c("glob", "regex", "fixed"),
  case_insensitive = TRUE,
  min_nchar = NULL,
  max_nchar = NULL,
  verbose = quanteda_options("verbose")
)

dfm_remove(x, ...)

dfm_keep(x, ...)

fcm_select(
  x,
  pattern = NULL,
  selection = c("keep", "remove"),
  valuetype = c("glob", "regex", "fixed"),
  case_insensitive = TRUE,
  verbose = quanteda_options("verbose"),
  ...
)

fcm_remove(x, pattern = NULL, ...)

fcm_keep(x, pattern = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the \link{dfm} or \link{fcm} object whose features will be selected}

\item{pattern}{a character vector, list of character vectors,
\link{dictionary}, or \link{collocations} object.  See \link{pattern} for
details.}

\item{selection}{whether to \code{keep} or \code{remove} the features}

\item{valuetype}{the type of pattern matching: \code{"glob"} for "glob"-style
  wildcard expressions; \code{"regex"} for regular expressions; or
  \code{"fixed"} for exact matching. See \link{valuetype} for details.

  For \code{dfm_select}, \code{pattern} may also be a \link{dfm}; see Value
  below.}

\item{case_insensitive}{ignore the case of dictionary values if \code{TRUE}}

\item{min_nchar, max_nchar}{optional numerics specifying the minimum and
maximum length in characters for tokens to be removed or kept; defaults are
\code{NULL} for no limits.  These are applied after (and hence, in addition
to) any selection based on pattern matches.}

\item{verbose}{if \code{TRUE} print message about how many pattern were
removed}

\item{...}{used only for passing arguments from \code{dfm_remove} or
\code{dfm_keep} to \code{dfm_select}. Cannot include
\code{selection}.}
}
\value{
A \link{dfm} or \link{fcm} object, after the feature selection has
  been applied.

  For compatibility with earlier versions, when \code{pattern} is a
  \link{dfm} object and \code{selection = "keep"}, then this will be
  equivalent to calling \code{\link{dfm_match}}.  In this case, the following
  settings are always used: \code{case_insensitive = FALSE}, and
  \code{valuetype = "fixed"}.  This functionality is deprecated, however, and
  you should use \code{\link{dfm_match}} instead.
}
\description{
This function selects or removes features from a \link{dfm} or \link{fcm},
based on feature name matches with \code{pattern}.  The most common usages
are to eliminate features from a dfm already constructed, such as stopwords,
or to select only terms of interest from a dictionary.
}
\details{
\code{dfm_remove} and \code{fcm_remove} are simply a convenience
  wrappers to calling \code{dfm_select} and \code{fcm_select} with
  \code{selection = "remove"}.

  \code{dfm_keep} and \code{fcm_keep} are simply a convenience wrappers to
  calling \code{dfm_select} and \code{fcm_select} with \code{selection =
  "keep"}.
}
\note{
This function selects features based on their labels.  To select
  features based on the values of the document-feature matrix, use
  \code{\link{dfm_trim}}.
