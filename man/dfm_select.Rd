\title{select features from a dfm or fcm}
\usage{
dfm_select(x, features = NULL, documents = NULL, selection = c("keep",
  "remove"), valuetype = c("glob", "regex", "fixed"),
  case_insensitive = TRUE, min_nchar = 1, max_nchar = 63,
  padding = FALSE, verbose = quanteda_options("verbose"), ...)

dfm_remove(x, features = NULL, documents = NULL, ...)

fcm_select(x, features = NULL, selection = c("keep", "remove"),
  valuetype = c("glob", "regex", "fixed"), case_insensitive = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE, ...)

fcm_remove(x, features, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the \link{dfm} or \link{fcm} object whose features will be selected}

\item{features}{a character vector, list of character vectors, \link{dictionary},
\link{collocations} or \link{dfm}. See \link{features} for details.}

\item{documents}{select documents based on their document names. Works exactly 
the same as features}

\item{selection}{whether to \code{keep} or \code{remove} the features}

\item{valuetype}{how to interpret keyword expressions: \code{"glob"} for 
"glob"-style wildcard expressions; \code{"regex"} for regular expressions;
or \code{"fixed"} for exact matching. See \link{valuetype} for details.}

\item{case_insensitive}{ignore the case of dictionary values if \code{TRUE}}

\item{min_nchar, max_nchar}{numerics specifying the minimum and maximum length
in characters for features to be removed or kept; defaults are 1 and 
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donaudampfschiffahrtselektrizit√§tenhauptbetriebswerkbauunterbeamtengesellschaft}{79}.
 (Set \code{max_nchar} to \code{NULL} for no upper limit.) These are
applied after (and hence, in addition to) any selection based on pattern
matches. These arguments are Ignored when padding is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{padding}{if \code{TRUE} features or documents not existing in x is 
added to \link{dfm}. This option is available only when selection is 
\code{keep} and valuetype is \code{fixed}.}

\item{verbose}{if \code{TRUE} print message about how many features were 
removed}

\item{...}{supplementary arguments passed to the underlying functions in 
\code{\link[stringi]{stri_detect_regex}}}
}
\value{
A \link{dfm} or \link{fcm} object, after the feature selection has been applied.
  
  When \code{features} is a \link{dfm} object and \code{padding} is \code{TRUE}, 
  then the returned object will be identical in its feature set to the dfm 
  supplied as the \code{features} argument. This means that any features in 
  \code{x} not in \code{features} will be discarded, and that any features in 
  found in the dfm supplied as \code{features} but not found in \code{x} will 
  be added with all zero counts.  Because selecting on a dfm is designed to produce 
  a selected dfm with an exact feature match, when \code{features} is
  a \link{dfm} object, then the following settings are always used: 
  \code{padding = TRUE}, 
  \code{case_insensitive = FALSE}, and \code{valuetype = "fixed"}.
  
  Selecting on a \link{dfm} is useful when you have trained a model 
  on one dfm, and need to project this onto a test set whose features must be 
  identical.  It is also used in \code{\link{bootstrap_dfm}}.  See examples.
}
\description{
This function selects or discards features from a \link{dfm} or \link{fcm}, based on a 
pattern match with the feature names.   The most common usages are to 
eliminate features from a dfm already constructed, such as stopwords, or to 
select only terms of interest from a dictionary.
}
\details{
\code{dfm_remove} and \code{fcm_remove} are simply a convenience
  wrappers to calling \code{dfm_select} and \code{fcm_select} with
  \code{selection = "remove"}.
}
\note{
This function selects features based on their labels.  To select 
  features based on the values of a the document-feature matrix, use 
  \code{\link{dfm_trim}}.
