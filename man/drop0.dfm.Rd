\title{Drop small values from a dfm (hard thresholding)}
\usage{
\method{drop0}{dfm}(x, tol = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a dfm object.}

\item{tol}{numeric; tolerance for values to drop (set to zero).
Cells with absolute value < tol are set to zero.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \code{Matrix::drop0()}.}
}
\value{
A dfm with small cell values set to zero, with docvars preserved.
}
\description{
Zeroes out values in a dfm below a threshold while preserving document
variables and names, unlike manual subsetting that drops dfm attributes.
}
\details{
This performs "hard thresholding" (matrix sparsification) on the dfm:
it increases the number of zero cells but does not change the dfm
dimensions. For removing features entirely, use \code{\link{dfm_trim}}.
