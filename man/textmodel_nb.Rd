\title{Naive Bayes classifier for texts}
\usage{
textmodel_nb(x, y, smooth = 1, prior = c("uniform", "docfreq", "termfreq"),
  distribution = c("multinomial", "Bernoulli"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the \link{dfm} on which the model will be fit.  Does not need to
contain only the training documents.}

\item{y}{vector of training labels associated with each document identified 
in \code{train}.  (These will be converted to factors if not already 
factors.)}

\item{smooth}{smoothing parameter for feature counts by class}

\item{prior}{prior distribution on texts; one of \code{"uniform"},
\code{"docfreq"}, or \code{"termfreq"}.  See Prior Distributions below.}

\item{distribution}{count model for text features, can be \code{multinomial}
or \code{Bernoulli}.  To fit a "binary multinomial" model, first convert
the dfm to a binary matrix using \code{\link{tf}(x, "boolean")}.}
}
\value{
\code{textmodel_nb()} returns a list consisting of the following (where
\eqn{I} is the total number of documents, \eqn{J} is the total number of
features, and \eqn{k} is the total number of training classes):

\item{call}{original function call}

\item{PwGc}{\eqn{k \times J}; probability of the word given the class
  (empirical likelihood)}

\item{Pc}{\eqn{k}-length named numeric vector of class prior
  probabilities}

\item{PcGw}{\eqn{k \times J}; posterior class probability given the
  word}

\item{Pw}{\eqn{J \times 1}; baseline probability of the word}

\item{x}{the \eqn{I \times J} training dfm \code{x}}

\item{y}{the \eqn{I}-length \code{y} training class vector}

\item{distribution}{the distribution argument}

\item{prior}{the prior argument}

\item{smooth}{the value of the smoothing parameter}

Fit a multinomial or Bernoulli Naive Bayes model, given a dfm and some
training labels.

\section{Prior distributions}{


Prior distributions refer to the prior probabilities assigned to the training
classes, and the choice of prior distribution affects the calculation of the
fitted probabilities.  The default is uniform priors, which sets the
unconditional probability of observing the one class to be the same as
observing any other class.

"Document frequency" means that the class priors will be taken from the
relative proportions of the class documents used in the training set.  This
approach is so common that it is assumed in many examples, such as the worked
example from Manning, Raghavan, and Schütze (2008) below.  It is not the
default in \pkg{quanteda}, however, since there may be nothing informative in
the relative numbers of documents used to train a classifier other than the
relative availability of the documents.  When training classes are balanced
in their number of documents (usually advisable), however, then the
empirically computed "docfreq" would be equivalent to "uniform" priors.

Setting \code{prior} to "termfreq" makes the priors equal to the proportions
of total feature counts found in the grouped documents in each training
class, so that the classes with the largest number of features are assigned
the largest priors. If the total count of features in each training class was
the same, then "uniform" and "termfreq" would be the same.
