\title{An R package for the quantitative analysis of textual data}
\description{
A set of functions for creating and managing text corpora, extracting
features from text corpora, and analyzing those features using quantitative
methods.
  
  \pkg{quanteda} makes it easy to manage texts in the form of a corpus,
  defined as a collection of texts that includes document-level variables
  specific to each text, as well as meta-data for documents and for the
  collection as a whole. \pkg{quanteda} includes tools to make it easy and
  fast to manipulate the texts in a corpus, by performing the most common
  natural language processing tasks simply and quickly, such as tokenizing,
  stemming, or forming ngrams. \pkg{quanteda}'s functions for tokenizing
  texts and forming multiple tokenized documents into a document-feature
  matrix are both extremely fast and extremely simple to use.
  \pkg{quanteda} can segment texts easily by words, paragraphs, sentences,
  or even user-supplied delimiters and tags.
  
  Built on the text processing functions in the \pkg{stringi} package, which
  is in turn built on C++ implementation of the ICU libraries for Unicode
  text handling, \pkg{quanteda} pays special attention to fast and correct
  implementation of Unicode and the handling of text in any character set.
  
  \pkg{quanteda} is built for efficiency and speed, through its design
  around three infrastructures: the \pkg{stringi} package for text
  processing, the \pkg{data.table} package for indexing large documents
  efficiently, and the \pkg{Matrix} package for sparse matrix objects. If you
  can fit it into memory, \pkg{quanteda} will handle it quickly. (And
  eventually, we will make it possible to process objects even larger than
  available memory.)
  
  \pkg{quanteda} is principally designed to allow users a fast and
  convenient method to go from a corpus of texts to a selected matrix of
  documents by features, after defining what the documents and features. The
  package makes it easy to redefine documents, for instance by splitting them
  into sentences or paragraphs, or by tags, as well as to group them into
  larger documents by document variables, or to subset them based on logical
  conditions or combinations of document variables. The package also
  implements common NLP feature selection functions, such as removing
  stopwords and stemming in numerous languages, selecting words found in
  dictionaries, treating words as equivalent based on a user-defined
  "thesaurus", and trimming and weighting features based on document
  frequency, feature frequency, and related measures such as tf-idf.
  
  Once constructed, a \pkg{quanteda} document-feature matrix ("\link{dfm}") 
  can be easily analyzed using
  either \pkg{quanteda}'s built-in tools for scaling document positions,
  or used with a number of other text analytic tools, such as: topic models
  (including converters for direct use with the topicmodels, LDA, and stm
  packages) document scaling (using \pkg{quanteda}'s own functions for the
  "wordfish" and "Wordscores" models, direct use with the \strong{ca} 
  package for
  correspondence analysis, or scaling with the austin package) machine
  learning through a variety of other packages that take matrix or
  matrix-like inputs.
  
  Additional features of \pkg{quanteda} include: \itemize{ 
  \item{powerful, flexible tools for working with \link[=dictionary]{dictionaries};}
  \item{the ability to identify \link[=textstat_keyness]{keywords} associated with documents or groups of documents;}
  \item{the ability to explore texts using \link[=kwic]{key-words-in-context};}
  \item{fast computation of a variety of \link[=textstat_readability]{readability indexes};}
  \item{fast computation of a variety of \link[=textstat_lexdiv]{lexical diversity measures};}
  \item{quick computation of word or document \link[=textstat_simil]{similarities}, for clustering or to compute distances for other purposes;}
  \item{a comprehensive suite of \link[=summary.corpus]{descriptive statistics on text} such as the number of sentences, words, characters, or
  syllables per document; and}
  \item{flexible, easy to use graphical tools to portray many of the analyses available in the package.}
