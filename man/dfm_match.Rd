\title{Match the feature set of a dfm to given feature names}
\usage{
dfm_match(x, features, verbose = quanteda_options("verbose"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \link{dfm}}

\item{features}{character; the feature names to be matched in the output dfm}

\item{verbose}{if \code{TRUE} print the number of tokens and documents before and
after the function is applied. The number of tokens does not include paddings.}
}
\value{
A \link{dfm} whose features are identical to those specified in
\code{features}.
}
\description{
Match the feature set of a \link{dfm} to a specified vector of feature names.
For existing features in \code{x} for which there is an exact match for an
element of \code{features}, these will be included.  Any features in \code{x}
not \code{features} will be discarded, and any feature names specified in
\code{features} but not found in \code{x} will be added with all zero counts.
}
\details{
Selecting on another \link{dfm}'s \code{\link[=featnames]{featnames()}} is useful when you
have trained a model on one dfm, and need to project this onto a test set
whose features must be identical. It is also used in
\code{\link[=bootstrap_dfm]{bootstrap_dfm()}}.
}
\note{
Unlike \code{\link[=dfm_select]{dfm_select()}}, this function will add feature names
not already present in \code{x}. It also provides only fixed,
case-sensitive matches.  For more flexible feature selection, see
\code{\link[=dfm_select]{dfm_select()}}.

\examples{
# matching a dfm to a feature vector
dfm_match(dfm(tokens("")), letters[1:5])
dfm_match(data_dfm_lbgexample, c("A", "B", "Z"))
dfm_match(data_dfm_lbgexample, c("B", "newfeat1", "A", "newfeat2"))

# matching one dfm to another
txt <- c("This is text one", "The second text", "This is text three")
(dfmat1 <- dfm(tokens(txt[1:2])))
(dfmat2 <- dfm(tokens(txt[2:3])))
(dfmat3 <- dfm_match(dfmat1, featnames(dfmat2)))
setequal(featnames(dfmat2), featnames(dfmat3))
