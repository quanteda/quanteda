\title{Remove sentences based on their token lengths or a pattern match}
\usage{
corpus_trimsentences(
  x,
  min_length = 1,
  max_length = 10000,
  exclude_pattern = NULL,
  return_tokens = FALSE
)

char_trimsentences(
  x,
  min_length = 1,
  max_length = 10000,
  exclude_pattern = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\link{corpus} or character object whose sentences will be selected.}

\item{min_length, max_length}{minimum and maximum lengths in word tokens 
(excluding punctuation)}

\item{exclude_pattern}{a \pkg{stringi} regular expression whose match (at the
sentence level) will be used to exclude sentences}

\item{return_tokens}{if \code{TRUE}, return tokens object of sentences after
trimming, otherwise return the input object type with the trimmed sentences
removed.}
}
\value{
a \link{corpus} or character vector equal in length to the input, or
  a tokenized set of sentences if .  If the input was a corpus, then the all
  docvars and metadata are preserved.  For documents whose sentences have
  been removed entirely, a null string (\code{""}) will be returned.
}
\description{
Removes sentences from a corpus or a character vector shorter than a 
specified length.

This function has been superseded by \code{\link{corpus_trim}}; use
  that function instead.
