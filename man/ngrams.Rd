\usage{
ngrams(x, ...)

\method{ngrams}{character}(x, n = 2L, skip = 0L, concatenator = "_", ...)

\method{ngrams}{tokenizedTexts}(x, ...)

\method{ngrams}{tokens}(x, n = 2L, skip = 0L, concatenator = "_",
  thread = 4, ...)

skipgrams(x, ...)

\method{skipgrams}{character}(x, n, skip, concatenator = "_", ...)

\method{skipgrams}{tokenizedTexts}(x, n, skip, concatenator = "_", ...)

\method{skipgrams}{tokens}(x, n, skip, concatenator = "_", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a tokenizedText object or a character vector of tokens}

\item{...}{not used}

\item{n}{integer vector specifying the number of elements to be concatenated 
in each ngram}

\item{skip}{integer vector specifying the adjacency skip size for tokens 
forming the ngrams, default is 0 for only immediately neighbouring words. 
For \code{skipgrams}, \code{skip} can be a vector of integers, as the 
"classic" approach to forming skip-grams is to set skip = \eqn{k} where
\eqn{k} is the distance for which \eqn{k} or fewer skips are used to construct
the \eqn{n}-gram.  Thus a "4-skip-n-gram" defined as \code{skip = 0:4}
produces results that include 4 skips, 3 skips, 2 skips, 1 skip, and 0
skips (where 0 skips are typical n-grams formed from adjacent words).  See
Guthrie et al (2006).}

\item{concatenator}{character for combining words, default is \code{_} 
(underscore) character}

\item{thread}{numbers of thread in the parallel mode}
}
\value{
a tokenizedTexts object consisting a list of character vectors of 
  ngrams, one list element per text, or a character vector if called on a 
  simple character vector
}
\description{
Create a set of ngrams (tokens in sequence) from character vectors or
tokenized text objects, with an optional skip argument to form skipgrams. 
Both the ngram length and the skip lengths take vectors of arguments to form 
multiple lengths or skips in one pass.  \code{ngrams()} is implemented in C++
for efficiency.
}
\details{
Normally, \code{\link{ngrams}} will be called through 
  \code{\link{tokenize}}, but these functions are also exported in case a 
  user wants to perform lower-level ngram construction on tokenized texts.
  
  \code{\link{skipgrams}} is a wrapper to \code{\link{ngrams}} that requires 
  arguments to be supplied for both \code{n} and \code{skip}.  For \eqn{k}-skip 
  skipgrams, set \code{skip} to \code{0:}\eqn{k}, in order to conform to the
  definition of skip-grams found in Guthrie et al (2006): A \eqn{k} skip-gram is
  an ngram which is a superset of all ngrams and each \eqn{(k-i)} skipgram until
  \eqn{(k-i)==0} (which includes 0 skip-grams).

\examples{
# ngrams
tokens <- tokens("the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.", 
                   removePunct = TRUE, simplify = TRUE)
ngrams(tokens, n = 1:3)
ngrams(tokens, n = c(2,4), concatenator = " ")
ngrams(tokens, n = c(2,4), skip = 1, concatenator = " ")

# skipgrams
# with "classic" tokenized objects
txt <- c("a b c d e", "c d e f g")
toks <- tokenize(txt)
ngrams(toks, n = 2:3)
txt <- c("a b c d e", "c d e f g")
toks_hashed <- tokens(txt)
ngrams(toks_hashed, n = 2:3)
tokens <- tokens("insurgents killed in ongoing fighting", simplify = TRUE)
skipgrams(tokens, n = 2, skip = 0:1, concatenator = " ") 
skipgrams(tokens, n = 2, skip = 0:2, concatenator = " ")
