  "fastestword", "fasterword"), removeNumbers = FALSE, removePunct = FALSE,
  removeSymbols = FALSE, removeSeparators = TRUE, removeTwitter = FALSE,
  removeHyphens = FALSE, removeURL = FALSE, ngrams = 1L, skip = 0L,

is.tokenizedTexts(x)

as.tokenizedTexts(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The text(s) or corpus to be tokenized}

\item{...}{additional arguments not used}

\item{what}{the unit for splitting the text, available alternatives are: 
\describe{ \item{\code{"word"}}{(recommended default) smartest, but 
slowest, word tokenization method; see 
\link[stringi]{stringi-search-boundaries} for details.} 
\item{\code{"fasterword"}}{dumber, but faster, word tokenizeation method, 
uses {\link[stringi]{stri_split_charclass}(x, "\\\\p{WHITE_SPACE}")}} 
\item{\code{"fastestword"}}{dumbest, but fastest, word tokenization method,
calls \code{\link[stringi]{stri_split_fixed}(x, " ")}} 
\item{\code{"character"}}{tokenization into individual characters} 
\item{\code{"sentence"}}{sentence segmenter, smart enough to handle some 
exceptions in English such as "Prof. Plum killed Mrs. Peacock." (but far 
from perfect).} }}

\item{removeNumbers}{remove tokens that consist only of numbers, but not 
words that start with digits, e.g. \code{2day}}

\item{removePunct}{if \code{TRUE}, remove all characters in the Unicode 
"Punctuation" [P] class}

\item{removeSymbols}{if \code{TRUE}, remove all characters in the Unicode 
"Symbol" [S] class}

\item{removeSeparators}{remove Separators and separator characters (spaces 
and variations of spaces, plus tab, newlines, and anything else in the 
Unicode "separator" category) when \code{removePunct=FALSE}.  Only 
applicable for \code{what = "character"} (when you probably want it to be 
\code{FALSE}) and for \code{what = "word"} (when you probably want it to be
\code{TRUE}).  Note that if \code{what = "word"} and you set 
\code{removePunct = TRUE}, then \code{removeSeparators} has no effect.  Use
carefully.}

\item{removeTwitter}{remove Twitter characters \code{@} and \code{#}; set to
\code{TRUE} if you wish to eliminate these.}

\item{removeHyphens}{if \code{TRUE}, split words that are connected by 
hyphenation and hyphenation-like characters in between words, e.g. 
\code{"self-storage"} becomes \code{c("self", "storage")}.  Default is 
\code{FALSE} to preserve such words as is, with the hyphens.  Only applies 
if \code{what = "word"}.}

\item{removeURL}{if \code{TRUE}, find and eliminate URLs beginning with
http(s) -- see section "Dealing with URLs".}

\item{ngrams}{integer vector of the \emph{n} for \emph{n}-grams, defaulting 
to \code{1} (unigrams). For bigrams, for instance, use \code{2}; for 
bigrams and unigrams, use \code{1:2}.  You can even include irregular 
sequences such as \code{2:3} for bigrams and trigrams only.  See 
\code{\link{ngrams}}.}

\item{skip}{integer vector specifying the skips for skip-grams, default is 0 
for only immediately neighbouring words. Only applies if \code{ngrams} is 
different from the default of 1.  See \code{\link{skipgrams}}.}

\item{concatenator}{character to use in concatenating \emph{n}-grams, default
is "\code{_}", which is recommended since this is included in the regular 
expression and Unicode definitions of "word" characters}

\item{simplify}{if \code{TRUE}, return a character vector of tokens rather 
than a list of length \code{\link{ndoc}(texts)}, with each element of the 
list containing a character vector of the tokens corresponding to that 
text.}

\item{verbose}{if \code{TRUE}, print timing messages to the console; off by 
default}
}
\value{
A list of length \code{\link{ndoc}(x)} of the tokens found in each text.

a \strong{tokenizedText} (S3) object, essentially a list of character
  vectors. If \code{simplify = TRUE} then return a single character vector.
}
\description{
Tokenize the texts from a character vector or from a corpus.

\code{is.tokenizedTexts} returns \code{TRUE} if the object is of class tokenizedTexts, \code{FALSE} otherwise.
}
\details{
The tokenizer is designed to be fast and flexible as well as to 
  handle Unicode correctly. Most of the time, users will construct \link{dfm}
  objects from texts or a corpus, without calling \code{tokenize()} as an 
  intermediate step.  Since \code{tokenize()} is most likely to be used by 
  more technical users, we have set its options to default to minimal 
  intervention. This means that punctuation is tokenized as well, and that 
  nothing is removed by default from the text being tokenized except 
  inter-word spacing and equivalent characters.

\code{as.tokenizedTexts} coerces a list of character tokens to a tokenizedText class object, 
making the methods available for this object type available to this object.
}
\note{
This replaces an older function named \code{clean()}, removed from 
  \pkg{quanteda} in version 0.8.1.  "Cleaning" by removing certain parts of 
  texts, such as punctuation or numbers, only only works on tokenized texts, 
  although texts of any length can be converted to lower case using 
  \code{\link{toLower}}.

\section{Dealing with URLs}{
 URLs are tricky to tokenize, because they contain
  a number of symbols and punctuation characters.  If you wish to remove 
  these, as most people do, and your text contains URLs, then you should set
  \code{what = "fasterword"} and \code{removeURL = TRUE}.  If you wish to
  keep the URLs, but do not want them mangled, then your options are more
  limited, since removing punctuation and symbols will also remove them from
  URLs.  We are working on improving this behaviour.
  
  See the examples below.

# same for character vectors and for lists
tokensFromChar <- tokenize(inaugTexts[1:3])
tokensFromCorp <- tokenize(subset(inaugCorpus, Year<1798))

# returned as a list
head(tokenize(inaugTexts[57])[[1]], 10)
# returned as a character vector using simplify=TRUE
head(tokenize(inaugTexts[57], simplify = TRUE), 10)

# removing punctuation marks and lowecasing texts
head(tokenize(toLower(inaugTexts[57]), simplify = TRUE, removePunct = TRUE), 30)
