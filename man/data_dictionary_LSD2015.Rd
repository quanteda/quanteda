\description{
The 2015 Lexicoder Sentiment Dictionary in \pkg{quanteda} \link{dictionary}
format.
}
\details{
The dictionary consists of 2,858 "negative" sentiment words and 1,709
"positive" sentiment words. A further set of 2,860 and 1,721 negations of
negative and positive words, respectively, is also included. While many users
will find the non-negation sentiment forms of the LSD adequate for sentiment
analysis, Young and Soroka (2012) did find a small, but non-negligible
increase in performance when accounting for negations. Users wishing to test
this or include the negations are encouraged to subtract negated positive
words from the count of positive words, and subtract the negated negative
words from the negative count.  

Young and Soroka (2012) also suggest the use of a pre-processing script to
remove specific cases of some words (i.e., "good bye", or "nobody better",
which should not be counted as positive). Pre-processing scripts are
available at \url{http://lexicoder.com}.
