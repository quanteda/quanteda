\title{Combine documents in a tokens object by a grouping variable}
\usage{
tokens_group(
  x,
  groups = docid(x),
  fill = FALSE,
  env = NULL,
  verbose = quanteda_options("verbose")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\link{tokens} object}

\item{groups}{grouping variable for sampling, equal in length to the number
of documents. This will be evaluated in the docvars data.frame, so that
docvars may be referred to by name without quoting. This also changes
previous behaviours for \code{groups}. See \code{news(Version >= "3.0", package = "quanteda")} for details.}

\item{fill}{logical; if \code{TRUE} and \code{groups} is a factor, then use all levels
of the factor when forming the new documents of the grouped object.  This
will result in a new "document" with empty content for levels not observed,
but for which an empty document may be needed.  If \code{groups} is a factor of
dates, for instance, then \code{fill = TRUE} ensures that the new object will
consist of one new "document" by date, regardless of whether any documents
previously existed with that date.  Has no effect if the \code{groups}
variable(s) are not factors.}

\item{env}{an environment or a list object in which \code{x} is searched.
Passed to \link{substitute} for non-standard evaluation.}

\item{verbose}{if \code{TRUE} print the number of tokens and documents before and
after the function is applied. The number of tokens does not include paddings.}
}
\value{
a \link{tokens} object whose documents are equal to the unique group
combinations, and whose tokens are the concatenations of the tokens by
group. Document-level variables that have no variation within groups are
saved in \link{docvars}.  Document-level variables that are lists are dropped
from grouping, even when these exhibit no variation within groups.
}
\description{
Combine documents in a \link{tokens} object by a grouping variable, by
concatenating the tokens in the order of the documents within each grouping
variable.

corp <- corpus(c("a a b", "a b c c", "a c d d", "a c c d"),
