\title{Compute the (weighted) document frequency of a feature}
\usage{
docfreq(
  x,
  scheme = c("count", "inverse", "inversemax", "inverseprob", "unary"),
  smoothing = 0,
  k = 0,
  base = 10,
  threshold = 0,
  use.names = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \link{dfm}}

\item{scheme}{type of document frequency weighting, computed as
follows, where \eqn{N} is defined as the number of documents in the dfm and
\eqn{s} is the smoothing constant:
\describe{
\item{\code{count}}{\eqn{df_j}, the number of documents for which \eqn{n_{ij} > threshold}}
\item{\code{inverse}}{\deqn{\textrm{log}_{base}\left(s + \frac{N}{k + df_j}\right)}}
\item{\code{inversemax}}{\deqn{\textrm{log}_{base}\left(s + \frac{\textrm{max}(df_j)}{k + df_j}\right)}}
\item{\code{inverseprob}}{\deqn{\textrm{log}_{base}\left(\frac{N - df_j}{k + df_j}\right)}}
\item{\code{unary}}{1 for each feature}
}}

\item{smoothing}{added to the quotient before taking the logarithm}

\item{k}{added to the denominator in the "inverse" weighting types, to 
prevent a zero document count for a term}

\item{base}{the base with respect to which logarithms in the inverse document
frequency weightings are computed; default is 10 (see Manning, 
  Raghavan, and Schütze 2008, p123).}

\item{threshold}{numeric value of the threshold \emph{above which} a feature 
will considered in the computation of document frequency.  The default is 
0, meaning that a feature's document frequency will be the number of 
documents in which it occurs greater than zero times.}

\item{use.names}{logical; if \code{TRUE} attach feature labels as names of 
the resulting numeric vector}

\item{...}{not used}
}
\value{
a numeric vector of document frequencies for each feature
}
\description{
For a \link{dfm} object, returns a (weighted) document frequency for each
term.  The default is a simple count of the number of documents in which a
feature occurs more than a given frequency threshold.  (The default threshold
is  zero, meaning that any feature occurring at least once in a document will
be counted.)
