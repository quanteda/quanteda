\title{compute the (weighted) document frequency of a feature}
\usage{
docfreq(x, scheme = c("count", "inverse", "inversemax", "inverseprob",
  "unary"), smoothing = 0, k = 0, base = 10, threshold = 0,
  USE.NAMES = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \link{dfm}}

\item{scheme}{type of document frequency weighting}

\item{smoothing}{added to the quotient before taking the logarithm}

\item{k}{added to the denominator in the "inverse" weighting types, to 
prevent a zero document count for a term}

\item{base}{the base with respect to which logarithms in the inverse document
frequency weightings are computed; default is 10 (see Manning, 
  Raghavan, and Schutze 2008, p123).}

\item{threshold}{numeric value of the threshold \emph{above which} a feature 
will considered in the computation of document frequency.  The default is 
0, meaning that a feature's document frequency will be the number of 
documents in which it occurs greater than zero times.}

\item{USE.NAMES}{logical; if \code{TRUE} attach feature labels as names of 
the resulting numeric vector}

\item{...}{not used}
}
\value{
a numeric vector of document frequencies for each feature
}
\description{
For a \link{dfm} object, returns a (weighted) document frequency for 
each term.  The default is a simple count of the number of documents in which
a feature occurs more than a given frequency threshold.  (The default 
threshold is  zero, meaning that any feature occuring at least once in a 
document will be counted.)
