\title{Bootstrap a dfm}
\usage{
bootstrap_dfm(x, n = 10, ..., verbose = quanteda_options("verbose"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \link{dfm} object}

\item{n}{number of resamples}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \code{\link[=dfm]{dfm()}}}

\item{verbose}{if \code{TRUE} print status messages}
}
\value{
A named list of \link{dfm} objects, where the first, \code{dfm_0}, is
the dfm from the original texts, and subsequent elements are the
sentence-resampled dfms.
}
\description{
Create an array of resampled dfms.
}
\details{
Function produces multiple, resampled \link{dfm} objects, based on
resampling sentences (with replacement) from each document, recombining
these into new "documents" and computing a dfm for each. Resampling of
sentences is done strictly within document, so that every resampled
document will contain at least some of its original tokens.
}
\examples{
set.seed(10)
txt <- c(textone = "This is a sentence.  Another sentence.  Yet another.",
         texttwo = "Premiere phrase.  Deuxieme phrase.")
dfmat <- corpus_reshape(corpus(txt), to = "sentences") |>
    tokens() |>
    dfm()
bootstrap_dfm(dfmat, n = 3)
