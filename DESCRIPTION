Description: A package for the management and quantitative analysis of textual
    data with R. ?quanteda makes it easy to manage texts in the form of a
    corpus, defined as a collection of texts that includes document-level
    variables specific to each text, as well as meta-data for documents and for
    the collection as a whole. quanteda includes tools to make it easy and fast
    to manuipulate the texts the texts in a corpus, for instance by tokenizine
    them, with or without stopwords or stemming, or to segment them by sentence
    or paragraph units. quanteda includes a suite of sophisticated tools to
    extract features of the texts into a quantitative matrix, where these
    features can be defined according to a dictionary or thesaurus, including
    the declaration of collocations to be treated as single features. Once
    converted into a quantitative matrix (known as a ``dfm" for
    document-feature matrix), the textual features can be analyzed using
    quantitative methods for describing, comparing, or scaling texts, or topic
    modelling, or used to train machine learning methods for class prediction.
